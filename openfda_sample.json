        "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION KEYTRUDA QLEX has different recommended dosage and administration than intravenous pembrolizumab. ( 2.2 ) KEYTRUDA QLEX is for subcutaneous use in the thigh or abdomen only. ( 2.2 ) Do not administer KEYTRUDA QLEX intravenously. ( 2.2 ) KEYTRUDA QLEX must be administered by a healthcare provider. ( 2.2 ) The recommended dose for adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older who weigh greater than 40 kg is: Every 3-week dosing (395 mg/4,800 units): Inject 2.4 mL subcutaneously in the abdomen or thigh over 1 minute. ( 2.3 ) Every 6-week dosing (790 mg/9,600 units): Inject 4.8 mL subcutaneously in the abdomen or thigh over 2 minutes. ( 2.3 ) For RCC, administer KEYTRUDA QLEX as a single agent in the adjuvant setting, or in the advanced setting with either: axitinib 5 mg orally twice daily or lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily. ( 2.3 ) For Endometrial Carcinoma, administer KEYTRUDA QLEX: in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel regardless of MMR or MSI status, or in combination with lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily for pMMR or not MSI-H tumors, or as a single agent for MSI-H or dMMR tumors. ( 2.3 ) See Full Prescribing Information for dosage modifications for adverse reactions and preparation and administration instructions. ( 2.4 , 2.5 ) 2.1 Patient Selection See information on FDA-approved tests for intravenous pembrolizumab. Information on FDA-approved tests for patient selection is available at: http://www.fda.gov/CompanionDiagnostics . Patient Selection for Single-Agent Treatment Select patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA QLEX as a single agent based on the presence of positive PD-L1 expression in: Stage III NSCLC who are not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . metastatic NSCLC [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. first-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . previously treated recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.10) ] . recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ] . For the MSI-H/dMMR indications, select patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA QLEX as a single agent based on MSI-H/dMMR status in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.7 , 14.8) ]. For the TMB-H indication, select patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA QLEX as a single agent based on TMB-H status in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.17) ]. Because subclonal dMMR mutations and microsatellite instability may arise in high-grade gliomas during temozolomide therapy, it is recommended to test for TMB-H, MSI-H, and dMMR in the primary tumor specimens obtained prior to initiation of temozolomide chemotherapy in patients with high-grade gliomas. Additional Patient Selection Information for MSI-H or dMMR in Patients with non-CRC Solid Tumors Due to discordance between local tests and FDA-approved tests, confirmation of MSI-H or dMMR status is recommended by an FDA-approved test in patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors, if feasible. If unable to perform confirmatory MSI-H/dMMR testing, the presence of TMB ≥10 mut/Mb, as determined by an FDA-approved test, may be used to select patients for treatment [see Clinical Studies (14.7) ] . Patient Selection for Combination Therapy For use of KEYTRUDA QLEX as a single agent as neoadjuvant treatment, then in combination with radiotherapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy then continued as a single agent as adjuvant treatment, select patients based on presence of positive PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1) in resectable locally advanced HNSCC [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . For use of KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, select patients based on the presence of positive PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1) in locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, and esophageal or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) carcinoma [see Clinical Studies (14.9) , (14.10) ]. An FDA-approved test for the detection of PD-L1 for the selection of patients with PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) expression in esophageal carcinoma in combination with platinum- and fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is not available. For use of KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, with or without bevacizumab, select patients based on the presence of positive PD-L1 expression in persistent, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.11) ]. For the pMMR/not MSI-H advanced endometrial carcinoma indication, select patients for treatment with KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with lenvatinib based on MMR or MSI status in tumor specimens [see Clinical Studies (14.16) ] . For use of KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, select patients based on the presence of positive PD-L1 expression in locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic TNBC [see Clinical Studies (14.19) ] . 2.2 Important Dosage and Administration Information KEYTRUDA QLEX has different recommended dosage and administration instructions than intravenous pembrolizumab. To reduce the risk of medication errors, check the vial labels to ensure that the drug being prepared and administered is KEYTRUDA QLEX for subcutaneous use and not intravenous pembrolizumab. Do not substitute KEYTRUDA QLEX with intravenous pembrolizumab because they have different recommended dosages and routes of administration. Patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab can switch to subcutaneous KEYTRUDA QLEX at their next scheduled dose. Patients receiving subcutaneous KEYTRUDA QLEX can switch to intravenous pembrolizumab at their next scheduled dose. Administer KEYTRUDA QLEX as a subcutaneous injection into the thigh or abdomen, avoiding the 5 cm area around the navel. Every 3-week dosing (395 mg/4,800 units) : inject 2.4 mL subcutaneously over 1 minute. Treatment duration is provided in Recommended Dosage (Table 1). Every 6-week dosing (790 mg/9,600 units): inject 4.8 mL subcutaneously over 2 minutes. Treatment duration is provided in Recommended Dosage (Table 1). Inject into healthy skin and never into areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, or hard. Ensure the injection site is at least 2.5 cm from the previous injection site. During treatment with KEYTRUDA QLEX, do not administer other medications for subcutaneous use at the same site as KEYTRUDA QLEX. Do not administer KEYTRUDA QLEX intravenously. KEYTRUDA QLEX must be administered by a healthcare provider. 2.3 Recommended Dosage The recommended dosages of KEYTRUDA QLEX are presented in Table 1. Every 3-week dosing (395 mg pembrolizumab and 4,800 units berahyaluronidase alfa): inject 2.4 mL subcutaneously over 1 minute. Every 6-week dosing (790 mg pembrolizumab and 9,600 units berahyaluronidase alfa): inject 4.8 mL subcutaneously over 2 minutes.

Withhold or discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX as shown in Table 2. Refer to lenvatinib prescribing information for additional dose modification information. 2.5 Preparation KEYTRUDA QLEX is a ready-to-use solution. Do not dilute KEYTRUDA QLEX. Do not shake. Preparation of the Syringe Remove KEYTRUDA QLEX vial from refrigerated storage [2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F)] and allow it to equilibrate to room temperature [20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F)] for at least 30 minutes. Prior to preparation for administration, if needed, the unpunctured vial may be stored at room temperature for up to 24 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. The solution is clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow. Discard the vial if visible particles are observed. Use a sterile, polypropylene or polycarbonate syringe and a stainless steel transfer needle (18 to 21 gauge) to withdraw KEYTRUDA QLEX from the vial. Every 3-week dosing (395 mg pembrolizumab/4,800 units berahyaluronidase alfa) : withdraw 2.4 mL into the syringe. Every 6-week dosing (790 mg pembrolizumab/9,600 units berahyaluronidase alfa) : withdraw 4.8 mL into the syringe. To avoid needle clogging, change the needle to a 25 to 30 gauge, ½-inch, stainless steel hypodermic injection needle immediately prior to subcutaneous injection. Discard any unused portion left in the vial. Storage of Prepared Syringe The product does not contain a preservative and should be used immediately after withdrawing from the vial. If not used immediately, store the syringe containing KEYTRUDA QLEX with the transfer needle and cap in place: At room temperature 20°C to 25°C (68°F to 77°F) for up to 8 hours, or In the refrigerator at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for up to 24 hours. The 24-hour period may include up to 8 hours at room temperature. Discard if storage time exceeds these limits. If refrigerated, allow the filled syringe to come to room temperature for at least 30 minutes prior to administration. Do not freeze."

        "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions ( 5.1 ) Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue, including the following: immune-mediated pneumonitis, immune-mediated colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis, immune-mediated endocrinopathies, immune-mediated nephritis with renal dysfunction, immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions, and solid organ transplant rejection. Monitor for early identification and management. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. Withhold or permanently discontinue based on severity and type of reaction. Hypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions: Interrupt injection and resume upon symptom resolution, or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX based on the severity of reaction. ( 5.2 ) Complications of Allogeneic HSCT: Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. ( 5.3 ) Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled clinical trials. ( 5.4 ) Embryo-Fetal toxicity: Can cause fetal harm. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus and to use effective method of contraception. ( 5.5 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA QLEX is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the programmed death-receptor 1 (PD-1) or the PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1), blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, thereby removing inhibition of the immune response, potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed under WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions, which may be severe or fatal, can occur in any organ system or tissue and can affect more than one body system simultaneously. Immune-mediated adverse reactions can occur at any time after starting treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. While immune-mediated adverse reactions usually manifest during treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies, immune-mediated adverse reactions can also manifest after discontinuation of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Early identification and management of immune-mediated adverse reactions are essential to ensure safe use of PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Evaluate liver enzymes, creatinine, and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA QLEX in the neoadjuvant setting, monitor blood cortisol at baseline, prior to surgery, and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions, initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies, including infection. Institute medical management promptly, including specialty consultation as appropriate. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . In general, if KEYTRUDA QLEX requires interruption or discontinuation, administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less, initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose immune-mediated adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy. Toxicity management guidelines for adverse reactions that do not necessarily require systemic steroids (e.g., endocrinopathies and dermatologic reactions) are discussed below. Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence of pneumonitis is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 5% (13/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including fatal (0.4%), Grade 3 (2%), and Grade 2 (1.2%) adverse reactions. Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including fatal (0.1%), Grade 4 (0.3%), Grade 3 (0.9%), and Grade 2 (1.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients with pneumonitis. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in 1.3% (36) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence of pneumonitis. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients. In a clinical study enrolling 580 adult patients with resected NSCLC (KEYNOTE-091) who received intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent for adjuvant treatment, pneumonitis occurred in 41 (7%) patients, including fatal (0.2%), Grade 4 (0.3%), and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis, 54% interrupted intravenous pembrolizumab, 63% discontinued intravenous pembrolizumab, and 71% had resolution. Immune-Mediated Colitis KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated colitis, which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis, consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.2% (3/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 3 (0.8%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (1.1%), and Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48) of patients with colitis. Additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.5% (15) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement; of these, 23% had recurrence of colitis. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients. Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.4% (1/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 2 (0.4%) adverse reactions. Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients with hepatitis. Eleven percent of these patients required additional immunosuppressant therapy. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.2% (6) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence of hepatitis. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients. In Combination with Axitinib KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grades 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations compared to KEYTRUDA QLEX alone. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt KEYTRUDA QLEX and axitinib, and consider administering corticosteroids as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Intravenous Pembrolizumab in Combination with Axitinib With the combination of intravenous pembrolizumab and axitinib, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times ULN (Grades 2-4, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either intravenous pembrolizumab (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, 16 patients receiving axitinib, and 24 patients receiving both intravenous pembrolizumab and axitinib. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies Adrenal Insufficiency KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher adrenal insufficiency, initiate symptomatic treatment, including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 2% (5/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 3 (0.4%), and Grade 2 (0.8%) adverse reactions. Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.3%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients with adrenal insufficiency; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in <0.1% (1) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement. Hypophysitis KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache, photophobia, or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.3%), and Grade 2 (0.2%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients with hypophysitis; of these, the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.1% (4) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement. Thyroid Disorders KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.4% (1/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 2 (0.4%). Hyperthyroidism occurred in 8% (20/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 2 (3.2%). Hypothyroidism occurred in 14% (35/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 2 (11%). Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including Grade 2 (0.3%). No patients discontinued intravenous pembrolizumab due to thyroiditis. Intravenous pembrolizumab was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients. Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). Hyperthyroidism led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in <0.1% (2) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement. The incidence of new or worsening hyperthyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 11% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.2%) hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). Hypothyroidism led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in <0.1% (1) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement. The majority of patients with hypothyroidism required long-term thyroid hormone replacement. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 1185 patients with HNSCC, occurring in 16% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent or in combination with platinum and FU, including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. The incidence of new or worsening hypothyroidism was higher in 580 patients with resected NSCLC, occurring in 22% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent as adjuvant treatment (KEYNOTE-091), including Grade 3 (0.3%) hypothyroidism. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, which can present with Diabetic Ketoacidosis Monitor patients for hyperglycemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate treatment with insulin as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in 0.4% (1/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy. Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent Type 1 diabetes mellitus occurred in 0.2% (6/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab. Type 1 diabetes mellitus led to permanent discontinuation in <0.1% (1) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in <0.1% (1) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement. All patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus required long-term insulin therapy. Immune-Mediated Nephritis with Renal Dysfunction KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated nephritis. Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent Immune-mediated nephritis occurred in 0.3% (9/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including Grade 4 (<0.1%), Grade 3 (0.1%), and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 89% (8/9) of patients with nephritis. Nephritis led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.1% (3) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.1% (3) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement; of these, none had recurrence of nephritis. Nephritis resolved in 56% of the 9 patients. Immune-Mediated Dermatologic Adverse Reactions KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause immune-mediated rash or dermatitis. Exfoliative dermatitis, including Stevens Johnson Syndrome, DRESS, and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), has occurred with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Topical emollients and/or topical corticosteroids may be adequate to treat mild to moderate non-exfoliative rashes. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX depending on severity [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.6% (4/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy, including Grade 4 (0.8%), and Grade 3 (0.8%) adverse reactions. Intravenous Pembrolizumab as a Single Agent Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions occurred in 1.4% (38/2799) of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab, including Grade 3 (1%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) adverse reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 40% (15/38) of patients with immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions led to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.1% (2) of patients and withholding of intravenous pembrolizumab in 0.6% (16) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated intravenous pembrolizumab after symptom improvement; of these, 6% had recurrence of immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions. Immune-mediated dermatologic adverse reactions resolved in 79% of the 38 patients. Other Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions The following clinically significant immune-mediated adverse reactions occurred at an incidence of <1% (unless otherwise noted) in patients who received KEYTRUDA QLEX, intravenous pembrolizumab, or were reported with the use of other PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies. Severe or fatal cases have been reported for some of these adverse reactions. Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis, pericarditis, vasculitis Nervous System: Meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis and demyelination, myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation), Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve paresis, autoimmune neuropathy Ocular: Uveitis, iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment, including blindness, can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions, consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome, as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss. Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis, to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels, gastritis (2.8%), duodenitis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis, rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae, including renal failure), arthritis (1.5%), polymyalgia rheumatica Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia, aplastic anemia, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis), sarcoidosis, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, solid organ transplant rejection, other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection 5.2 Hypersensitivity and Administration-Related Reactions KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause severe or life-threatening administration-related reactions, including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. In Study MK-3475A-D77, hypersensitivity and administration-related systemic reactions occurred in 3.2% (8/251) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA QLEX, including Grade 2 (2.8%). Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of administration-related systemic reactions including rigors, chills, wheezing, pruritus, flushing, rash, hypotension, hypoxemia, and fever. Interrupt injection (if not already fully administered) and resume if symptoms resolve for mild or moderate hypersensitivity and administration-related systemic reactions. For severe or life-threatening hypersensitivity and administration-related systemic reactions, stop injection and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA QLEX [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 5.3 Complications of Allogeneic HSCT Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) before or after being treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) after reduced intensity conditioning, and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between PD-1/PD-L1 blockade and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of transplant-related complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit versus risks of treatment with a PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibody prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT. 5.4 Increased Mortality in Patients with Multiple Myeloma when Pembrolizumab is Added to a Thalidomide Analogue and Dexamethasone In two randomized trials in patients with multiple myeloma, the addition of intravenous pembrolizumab to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone, a use for which no PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody is indicated, resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma with a PD-1 or PD-L1 blocking antibody in combination with a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone is not recommended outside of controlled trials. 5.5 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway can lead to increased risk of immune-related rejection of the developing fetus resulting in fetal death. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA QLEX and for 4 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) ]."

The data described in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS reflect exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent in 2799 patients in three randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials (KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, and KEYNOTE-010), which enrolled 912 patients with melanoma and 682 patients with NSCLC, and one single-arm trial (KEYNOTE-001), which enrolled 655 patients with melanoma and 550 patients with NSCLC. In addition to the 2799 patients, certain subsections in the WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS describe adverse reactions observed with exposure to KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (Study MK-3475A-D77), which enrolled 251 patients with NSCLC; intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-091), which enrolled 580 patients with resected NSCLC; a non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trial (KEYNOTE-012), a non-randomized, open-label, single-cohort trial (KEYNOTE-055), and two randomized, open-label, active-controlled trials (KEYNOTE-040 and KEYNOTE-048 single agent arms), which enrolled 909 patients with HNSCC; in a randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-048 combination arm), which enrolled 276 patients with HNSCC; in combination with axitinib in a randomized, active-controlled trial (KEYNOTE-426), which enrolled 429 patients with RCC; and in post-marketing use. Across all trials, patients were administered either KEYTRUDA QLEX 790 mg/9,600 units every 6 weeks or intravenous pembrolizumab at doses of 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks, or 200 mg every 3 weeks. Among the 2799 patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab, 41% were exposed for 6 months or more and 21% were exposed for 12 months or more. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients who received KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy were nausea (25%), fatigue (25%), and musculoskeletal pain (21%). The safety of KEYTRUDA QLEX for the approved indications is also based on the safety of intravenous pembrolizumab given as a single agent or in combination with other antitumor medicines. The most common adverse reactions (≥20%) in patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab were: as a single agent : fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, rash, diarrhea, pyrexia, cough, decreased appetite, pruritus, dyspnea, constipation, pain, abdominal pain, nausea, and hypothyroidism. in combination with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy : fatigue/asthenia, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, decreased appetite, rash, vomiting, cough, dyspnea, pyrexia, alopecia, peripheral neuropathy, mucosal inflammation, stomatitis, headache, weight loss, abdominal pain, arthralgia, myalgia, insomnia, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, urinary tract infection, hypothyroidism, radiation skin injury, dysphagia, dry mouth, and musculoskeletal pain. in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab : peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, anemia, fatigue/asthenia, nausea, neutropenia, diarrhea, hypertension, thrombocytopenia, constipation, arthralgia, vomiting, urinary tract infection, rash, leukopenia, hypothyroidism, and decreased appetite. in combination with axitinib : diarrhea, fatigue/asthenia, hypertension, hepatotoxicity, hypothyroidism, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, stomatitis/mucosal inflammation, dysphonia, rash, cough, and constipation. in combination with lenvatinib : hypothyroidism, hypertension, fatigue, diarrhea, musculoskeletal disorders, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, stomatitis, weight loss, abdominal pain, urinary tract infection, proteinuria, constipation, headache, hemorrhagic events, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, dysphonia, rash, hepatotoxicity, and acute kidney injury. in combination with enfortumab vedotin : rash, peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, pruritus, diarrhea, alopecia, weight loss, decreased appetite, dry eye, nausea, constipation, dysgeusia, and urinary tract infection. Adverse Reactions in Patients with NSCLC Treated with KEYTRUDA QLEX The safety of KEYTRUDA QLEX compared to intravenous pembrolizumab in patients with previously untreated, metastatic NSCLC with no EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genomic tumor aberrations was evaluated in Study MK-3475A-D77 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. A total of 377 patients received either KEYTRUDA QLEX 790 mg/9,600 units every 6 weeks in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy (n=251) or intravenous pembrolizumab 400 mg every 6 weeks in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy (n=126). Among patients who received KEYTRUDA QLEX, 58% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 3.2% were exposed for greater than one year. The median age of patients who received KEYTRUDA QLEX was 65 years (range: 39 to 87); 73% male, 63% White; 29% Asian, 4.8% multiple races, 2% Black or African American, 0.8% Alaska Native or American Indian; and 29% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 39% of patients who received KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy. Serious adverse reactions in ≥1% of patients who received KEYTRUDA QLEX were pneumonia (10%), thrombocytopenia (4%), febrile neutropenia (4%), neutropenia (2.8%), musculoskeletal pain (2%), pneumonitis (2%), diarrhea (1.6%), rash (1.2%), respiratory failure (1.2%), and anemia (1.2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 10% of patients who received KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with chemotherapy including pneumonia (3.2%), neutropenic sepsis (2%), death not otherwise specified (1.6%), respiratory failure (1.2%), parotitis (0.4%), pneumonitis (0.4%), pneumothorax (0.4%), pulmonary embolism (0.4%), neutropenic colitis (0.4%), and seizure (0.4%). Permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA QLEX due to an adverse reaction occurred in 16% of patients. Adverse reactions which resulted in permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA QLEX in ≥2% of patients included pneumonia and pneumonitis. Dosage interruptions of KEYTRUDA QLEX due to an adverse reaction occurred in 45% of patients. Adverse reactions which required dosage interruption in ≥2% of patients included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, rash, and increased aspartate aminotransferase. Tables 4 and 5 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients on KEYTRUDA QLEX in Study MK-3475A-D77.

Below is a description of adverse reactions of intravenous pembrolizumab in these adequate and well-controlled studies. Melanoma Ipilimumab-Naive Melanoma The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who had not received prior ipilimumab and who had received no more than one prior systemic therapy was investigated in KEYNOTE-006. KEYNOTE-006 was a multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial where patients were randomized (1:1:1) and received intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=278) or intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks (n=277) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or ipilimumab 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses unless discontinued earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (n=256) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Patients with autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C, were ineligible. The median duration of exposure was 5.6 months (range: 1 day to 11.0 months) for intravenous pembrolizumab and similar in both treatment arms. Fifty-one and 46% of patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks, respectively, for ≥6 months. No patients in either arm received treatment for more than one year. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89); 60% male; 98% White; 32% had an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value at baseline; 65% had M1c stage disease; 9% with history of brain metastasis; and approximately 36% had been previously treated with systemic therapy which included a BRAF inhibitor (15%), chemotherapy (13%), and immunotherapy (6%). In KEYNOTE-006, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the every 2 week and every 3 week schedule, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=555) of both intravenous pembrolizumab arms. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 9% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab in more than one patient were colitis (1.4%), autoimmune hepatitis (0.7%), allergic reaction (0.4%), polyneuropathy (0.4%), and cardiac failure (0.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) was diarrhea (2.5%). Tables 6 and 7 summarize selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients on intravenous pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-006. Table 6: Selected Adverse reactions occurring at same or higher incidence than in the ipilimumab arm Adverse Reactions Occurring in ≥10% of Patients Receiving Intravenous Pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-006 Adverse Reaction Intravenous Pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks Ipilimumab n=555 n=256 All Grades Graded per NCI CTCAE v4.0 (%) Grades 3-4 (%) All Grades (%) Grades 3-4 (%) General Fatigue 28 0.9 28 3.1 Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Rash Includes rash, rash erythematous, rash follicular, rash generalized, rash macular, rash maculo-papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, and exfoliative rash. 24 0.2 23 1.2 Vitiligo Includes skin hypopigmentation 13 0 2 0 Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Arthralgia 18 0.4 10 1.2 Back pain 12 0.9 7 0.8 Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Cough 17 0 7 0.4 Dyspnea 11 0.9 7 0.8 Metabolism and Nutrition Decreased appetite 16 0.5 14 0.8 Nervous System Headache 14 0.2 14 0.8 Other clinically important adverse reactions occurring in ≥10% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab were diarrhea (26%), nausea (21%), and pruritus (17%). Table 7: Selected Laboratory abnormalities occurring at same or higher incidence than in ipilimumab arm Laboratory Abnormalities Worsened from Baseline Occurring in ≥20% of Melanoma Patients Receiving Intravenous Pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-006 Laboratory Test Each test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one on-study laboratory measurement available: intravenous pembrolizumab (520 to 546 patients) and ipilimumab (237 to 247 patients); hypertriglyceridemia: intravenous pembrolizumab n=429 and ipilimumab n=183; hypercholesterolemia: intravenous pembrolizumab n=484 and ipilimumab n=205.

Ipilimumab-Refractory Melanoma The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor, was investigated in KEYNOTE-002. KEYNOTE-002 was a multicenter, partially blinded (intravenous pembrolizumab dose), randomized (1:1:1), active-controlled trial in which 528 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n=178) or 10 mg/kg (n=179) every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=171), consisting of dacarbazine (26%), temozolomide (25%), paclitaxel and carboplatin (25%), paclitaxel (16%), or carboplatin (8%) [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Patients with autoimmune disease, severe immune-related toxicity related to ipilimumab, defined as any Grade 4 toxicity or Grade 3 toxicity requiring corticosteroid treatment (greater than 10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent dose) for greater than 12 weeks; medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication; a history of interstitial lung disease; or an active infection requiring therapy, including HIV or hepatitis B or C, were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.7 months (range: 1 day to 16.6 months) and to intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 4.8 months (range: 1 day to 16.8 months). In the intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg arm, 36% of patients were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥6 months and 4% were exposed for ≥12 months. In the 10 mg/kg arm, 41% of patients were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥6 months and 6% of patients were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥12 months. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 15 to 89); 61% male; 98% White; 41% had an elevated LDH value at baseline; 83% had M1c stage disease; 73% received two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease (100% received ipilimumab and 25% a BRAF inhibitor); and 15% with history of brain metastasis. In KEYNOTE-002, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the 2 mg/kg dose and 10 mg/kg dose, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=357) of both intravenous pembrolizumab arms. Adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation occurred in 12% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab; the most common (≥1%) were general physical health deterioration (1%), asthenia (1%), dyspnea (1%), pneumonitis (1%), and generalized edema (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 14% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were dyspnea (1%), diarrhea (1%), and maculo-papular rash (1%). Tables 8 and 9 summarize adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients on intravenous pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-002.

Adjuvant Treatment of Resected Stage IIB or IIC Melanoma Among the 969 patients with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma enrolled in KEYNOTE-716 [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] treated with intravenous pembrolizumab, the median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab was 9.9 months (range: 0 to 15.4 months). Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were ineligible. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with Stage IIB or IIC melanoma were similar to those occurring in 1011 patients with Stage III melanoma from KEYNOTE-054 or the 2799 patients with melanoma or NSCLC treated with intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent. Adjuvant Treatment of Stage III Resected Melanoma The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent was investigated in KEYNOTE-054, a randomized (1:1) double-blind trial in which 1019 patients with completely resected Stage IIIA (>1 mm lymph node metastasis), IIIB or IIIC melanoma received 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (n=509) or placebo (n=502) for up to one year [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression or mucosal or ocular melanoma were ineligible. Seventy-six percent of patients received intravenous pembrolizumab for 6 months or longer. The study population characteristics were: median age of 54 years (range: 19 to 88), 25% age 65 or older; 62% male; and 94% ECOG PS of 0 and 6% ECOG PS of 1. Sixteen percent had Stage IIIA, 46% had Stage IIIB, 18% had Stage IIIC (1-3 positive lymph nodes), and 20% had Stage IIIC (≥4 positive lymph nodes). Two patients treated with intravenous pembrolizumab died from causes other than disease progression; causes of death were drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and autoimmune myositis with respiratory failure. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 25% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab. Adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation occurred in 14% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab; the most common (≥1%) were pneumonitis (1.4%), colitis (1.2%), and diarrhea (1%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 19% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (2.4%), pneumonitis (2%), increased ALT (1.4%), arthralgia (1.4%), increased AST (1.4%), dyspnea (1%), and fatigue (1%).

A total of 607 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg, pemetrexed and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by intravenous pembrolizumab and pemetrexed (n=405) or placebo, pemetrexed, and platinum every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed (n=202). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks was 7.2 months (range: 1 day to 20.1 months). Sixty percent of patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥6 months. Seventy-two percent of patients received carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84), 49% age 65 or older; 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; and 18% with history of brain metastases at baseline. Intravenous pembrolizumab was discontinued for adverse reactions in 20% of patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab were pneumonitis (3%) and acute kidney injury (2%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 53% of patients; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab (≥2%) were neutropenia (13%), asthenia/fatigue (7%), anemia (7%), thrombocytopenia (5%), diarrhea (4%), pneumonia (4%), increased blood creatinine (3%), dyspnea (2%), febrile neutropenia (2%), upper respiratory tract infection (2%), increased ALT (2%), and pyrexia (2%).

Safety data are available for the first 203 patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab and chemotherapy (n=101) or placebo and chemotherapy (n=102). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab was 7 months (range: 1 day to 12 months). Sixty-one percent of patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥6 months. A total of 139 of 203 patients (68%) received paclitaxel and 64 patients (32%) received paclitaxel protein-bound in combination with carboplatin. The study population characteristics were: median age of 65 years (range: 40 to 83), 52% age 65 or older; 78% male; 83% White; and 9% with history of brain metastases. Intravenous pembrolizumab was discontinued for adverse reactions in 15% of patients, with no single type of adverse reaction accounting for the majority. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 43% of patients; the most common (≥2%) were thrombocytopenia (20%), neutropenia (11%), anemia (6%), asthenia (2%), and diarrhea (2%). The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were febrile neutropenia (6%), pneumonia (6%), and urinary tract infection (3%). The adverse reactions observed in KEYNOTE-407 were similar to those observed in KEYNOTE-189 with the exception that increased incidences of alopecia (47% vs. 36%) and peripheral neuropathy (31% vs. 25%) were observed in the intravenous pembrolizumab and chemotherapy arm compared to the placebo and chemotherapy arm in KEYNOTE-407. Previously Untreated NSCLC The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-042, a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in 1251 patients with PD-L1 expressing, previously untreated Stage III NSCLC who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation or metastatic NSCLC [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=636) or investigator's choice of chemotherapy (n=615), consisting of pemetrexed and carboplatin followed by optional pemetrexed (n=312) or paclitaxel and carboplatin followed by optional pemetrexed (n=303) every 3 weeks. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations; autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab was 5.6 months (range: 1 day to 27.3 months). Forty-eight percent of patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg for ≥6 months. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 25 to 90), 45% age 65 or older; 71% male; and 64% White, 30% Asian, and 2% Black. Nineteen percent were Hispanic or Latino. Eighty-seven percent had metastatic disease (Stage IV), 13% had Stage III disease (2% Stage IIIA and 11% Stage IIIB), and 5% had treated brain metastases at baseline. Intravenous pembrolizumab was discontinued for adverse reactions in 19% of patients. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab were pneumonitis (3.0%), death due to unknown cause (1.6%), and pneumonia (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 33% of patients; the most common adverse reactions or laboratory abnormalities leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab (≥2%) were pneumonitis (3.1%), pneumonia (3.0%), hypothyroidism (2.2%), and increased ALT (2.0%). The most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (7%), pneumonitis (3.9%), pulmonary embolism (2.4%), and pleural effusion (2.2%). Tables 14 and 15 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-042.

A total of 991 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (n=339) or 10 mg/kg (n=343) every 3 weeks or docetaxel (n=309) at 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks. Patients with autoimmune disease, medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medication, or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 22.4 months) and to intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks was 3.5 months (range 1 day to 20.8 months). The data described below reflect exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg in 31% of patients exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥6 months. In the intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg arm, 34% of patients were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥6 months. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 20 to 88), 42% age 65 or older; 61% male; 72% White and 21% Asian; and 8% with advanced localized disease, 91% with metastatic disease, and 15% with history of brain metastases. Twenty-nine percent received two or more prior systemic treatments for advanced or metastatic disease. In KEYNOTE-010, the adverse reaction profile was similar for the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg dose, therefore summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis (n=682). Treatment was discontinued for adverse reactions in 8% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab. The most common adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab was pneumonitis (1.8%). Adverse reactions leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 23% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were diarrhea (1%), fatigue (1.3%), pneumonia (1%), liver enzyme elevation (1.2%), decreased appetite (1.3%), and pneumonitis (1%). Tables 16 and 17 summarize adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, in patients on intravenous pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-010.

Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Resectable NSCLC The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with neoadjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by surgery and continued adjuvant treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent after surgery was investigated in KEYNOTE-671, a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with previously untreated and resectable Stage II, IIIA, or IIIB (N2) NSCLC by AJCC 8th edition [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ]. Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks was 10.9 months (range: 1 day to 18.6 months). The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 26 to 83), 45% age 65 or older, 7% age 75 or older; 71% male; 61% White, 31% Asian, 2% Black, 4% race not reported; 9% Hispanic or Latino. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with resectable NSCLC receiving intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with platinum containing chemotherapy, given as neoadjuvant treatment and continued as single agent adjuvant treatment, were generally similar to those occurring in patients in other clinical trials across tumor types receiving intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant Phase of KEYNOTE-671 A total of 396 patients received at least 1 dose of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment and 399 patients received at least 1 dose of placebo in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment; the most frequent (≥2%) serious adverse reactions were pneumonia (4.8%), venous thromboembolism (3.3%), and anemia (2%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.3% of patients, including death due to unknown cause (0.8%), sepsis (0.3%), and immune-mediated lung disease (0.3%). Permanent discontinuation of any study drug due to an adverse reaction occurred in 18% of patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy as neoadjuvant treatment; the most frequent (≥1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation of any study drug were acute kidney injury (1.8%), interstitial lung disease (1.8%), anemia (1.5%), neutropenia (1.5%), and pneumonia (1.3%). Of the 396 intravenous pembrolizumab-treated patients and 399 placebo-treated patients who received neoadjuvant treatment, 6% (n=25) and 4.3% (n=17), respectively, did not receive surgery due to adverse reactions. The most frequent (≥1%) adverse reactions that led to cancellation of surgery in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm was interstitial lung disease (1%). Of the 325 intravenous pembrolizumab-treated patients who received surgery, 3.1% (n=10) experienced delay of surgery (surgery more than 8 weeks from last neoadjuvant treatment if patient received less than 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy or more than 20 weeks after first dose of neoadjuvant treatment if patient received 4 cycles of neoadjuvant therapy) due to adverse reactions. Of the 317 placebo-treated patients who received surgery, 2.5% (n=8) experienced delay of surgery due to adverse reactions. Of the 325 intravenous pembrolizumab-treated patients who received surgery, 7% (n=22) did not receive adjuvant treatment due to adverse reactions. Of the 317 placebo-treated patients who received surgery, 3.2% (n=10) did not receive adjuvant treatment due to adverse reactions. Adjuvant Phase of KEYNOTE-671 A total of 290 patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm and 267 patients in the placebo arm received at least 1 dose of adjuvant treatment. Of the patients who received single agent intravenous pembrolizumab as adjuvant treatment, 14% experienced serious adverse reactions; the most frequent serious adverse reaction was pneumonia (3.4%). One fatal adverse reaction of pulmonary hemorrhage occurred. Permanent discontinuation of adjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab due to an adverse reaction occurred in 12% of patients; the most frequent (≥1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation of adjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab were diarrhea (1.7%), interstitial lung disease (1.4%), AST increased (1%), and musculoskeletal pain (1%). Adjuvant Treatment of Resected NSCLC The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent was investigated in KEYNOTE-091, a multicenter, randomized (1:1), triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with completely resected Stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC; adjuvant chemotherapy up to 4 cycles was optional [see Clinical Studies (14.3) ] . A total of 1161 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg (n=580) or placebo (n=581) every 3 weeks. Patients were ineligible if they had active autoimmune disease, were on chronic immunosuppressive agents, or had a history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab was 11.7 months (range: 1 day to 18.9 months). Sixty-eight percent of patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥6 months. The adverse reactions observed in KEYNOTE-091 were generally similar to those occurring in other patients with NSCLC receiving intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent, with the exception of hypothyroidism (22%), hyperthyroidism (11%), and pneumonitis (7%). Two fatal adverse reactions of myocarditis occurred. Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) First-line treatment of unresectable advanced or metastatic MPM with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy (either carboplatin or cisplatin) was investigated in KEYNOTE-483, a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in patients with previously untreated, unresectable advanced or metastatic MPM [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . A total of 473 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg, pemetrexed, and platinum every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles followed by intravenous pembrolizumab (n=241), or pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy every 3 weeks for up to 6 cycles (n=232). Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 3 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks was 6.9 months (range: 1 day to 25.2 months). Sixty-one percent of patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥6 months. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with MPM were generally similar to those in other patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. HNSCC Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Locally Advanced HNSCC The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment added to standard of care (SOC) therapy was evaluated in KEYNOTE-689, a multicenter, randomized (1:1), open-label, active-controlled trial in patients with resectable locally advanced (Stage III-IVA by AJCC 8th edition) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. Intravenous pembrolizumab was administered as single-agent neoadjuvant therapy before definitive surgery, during adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) with or without concurrent cisplatin, and then as single agent adjuvant therapy. Concurrent cisplatin was added to intravenous pembrolizumab and adjuvant RT for high-risk disease pathology. A total of 361 patients received treatment on the intravenous pembrolizumab arm and 315 patients received treatment on the SOC therapy arm. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab in the neoadjuvant phase was 3.1 weeks (range: 1 day to 4.9 weeks). The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab in the adjuvant phase was 42 weeks (range: 1 day to 82 weeks). The median age of patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab was 60 years (range: 29 to 82), 32% age 65 or older, 6% age 75 or older; 79% male; 78% White, 14% Asian, 2.2% Black or African American, 2% Other races, 2.7% unknown race; and 15% Hispanic or Latino. The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) on the intravenous pembrolizumab arm were stomatitis (48%), radiation skin injury (40%), weight loss (36%), fatigue (33%), dysphagia (29%), constipation (27%), hypothyroidism (26%), nausea (24%), rash (22%), dry mouth (22%), diarrhea (22%), and musculoskeletal pain (22%).

Serious adverse reactions that occurred in more than one patient were pneumonia (1.4%), tumor hemorrhage (0.8%), dysphagia (0.6%), immune mediated hepatitis (0.6%), cellulitis (0.6%), and dyspnea (0.6%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.1% of patients who received neoadjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab including respiratory failure, clostridium infection, septic shock, and myocardial infarction (one patient each). Permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab due to an adverse reaction occurred in 2.8% of patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant treatment. The most frequent adverse reaction which resulted in permanent discontinuation of neoadjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab in more than one patient was arthralgia (0.6%). Of the 361 patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab as neoadjuvant treatment, 11% (n=38) did not receive surgery. Surgical cancellation on the intravenous pembrolizumab arm was due to disease progression in 4% (n=15), patient decision in 3% (n=10), adverse reactions in 1.4% (n=5), physician’s decision in 1.1% (n=4), unresectable tumor in 0.6% (n=2), loss of follow-up in 0.3% (n=1), and use of non-study anti-cancer therapy in 0.3% (n=1). Of the 351 patients randomized to SOC, 12% (n=43) did not receive surgery. Surgical cancellation on the SOC arm was due to patient decision in 7% (n=24), physician’s decision in 2.3% (n=8), disease progression in 1.7% (n=6), and adverse reactions in 1.4% (n=5). Of the 323 intravenous pembrolizumab-treated patients who received surgery, 1.2% (n=4) experienced delay of surgery (defined as on-study surgery occurring ≥ 9 weeks after initiation of neoadjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab) due to adverse reactions.

Permanent discontinuation of adjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab due to an adverse reaction occurred in 17% of patients. The most frequent (≥1%) adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation of adjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab were pneumonitis, colitis, immune-mediated hepatitis and death not otherwise specified. Of the 275 patients who received SOC in the adjuvant phase, 23% experienced serious adverse reactions. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in >1% of SOC-treated patients were pneumonia (3.6%) and acute kidney injury (3.3%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4.7% including pneumonia (0.7%), septic shock (0.4%), death not otherwise specified (0.4%), sudden death (0.4%), myocardial infarction (0.4%), pancreatic neoplasm (0.4%) and other infections (2.9%). First-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab, as a single agent and in combination with platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) and FU chemotherapy, was investigated in KEYNOTE-048, a multicenter, open-label, randomized (1:1:1), active-controlled trial in patients with previously untreated, recurrent or metastatic HNSCC [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. A total of 576 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks either as a single agent (n=300) or in combination with platinum and FU (n=276) every 3 weeks for 6 cycles followed by intravenous pembrolizumab, compared to 287 patients who received cetuximab weekly in combination with platinum and FU every 3 weeks for 6 cycles followed by cetuximab. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab was 3.5 months (range: 1 day to 24.2 months) in the intravenous pembrolizumab single agent arm and was 5.8 months (range: 3 days to 24.2 months) in the combination arm. Seventeen percent of patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab single agent arm and 18% of patients in the combination arm were exposed to intravenous pembrolizumab for ≥12 months. Fifty-seven percent of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy started treatment with carboplatin. Intravenous pembrolizumab was discontinued for adverse reactions in 12% of patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab single agent arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab were sepsis (1.7%) and pneumonia (1.3%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 31% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab (≥2%) were pneumonia (2.3%), pneumonitis (2.3%), and hyponatremia (2%). Intravenous pembrolizumab was discontinued for adverse reactions in 16% of patients in the combination arm. The most common adverse reactions resulting in permanent discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab were pneumonia (2.5%), pneumonitis (1.8%), and septic shock (1.4%). Adverse reactions leading to the interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 45% of patients; the most common adverse reactions leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab (≥2%) were neutropenia (14%), thrombocytopenia (10%), anemia (6%), pneumonia (4.7%), and febrile neutropenia (2.9%).

Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible for KEYNOTE-012. The study population characteristics were: median age of 60 years (range: 20 to 84), 35% age 65 or older; 83% male; and 77% White, 15% Asian, and 5% Black. Sixty-one percent of patients had two or more lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting, and 95% had prior radiation therapy. Baseline ECOG PS was 0 (30%) or 1 (70%) and 86% had M1 disease. Intravenous pembrolizumab was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 17% of patients. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 45% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 2% of patients were pneumonia, dyspnea, confusional state, vomiting, pleural effusion, and respiratory failure. The incidence of adverse reactions, including serious adverse reactions, was similar between dosage regimens (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks); therefore, summary safety results are provided in a pooled analysis. The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥20% of patients) were fatigue, decreased appetite, and dyspnea. Adverse reactions occurring in patients with HNSCC were generally similar to those occurring in 2799 patients with melanoma or NSCLC treated with intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent, with the exception of increased incidences of facial edema (10% all Grades; 2.1% Grades 3-4) and new or worsening hypothyroidism [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Urothelial Cancer Patients with urothelial cancer in combination with enfortumab vedotin The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin was investigated in KEYNOTE-A39 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. A total of 440 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 and enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle compared to 433 patients who received gemcitabine on Days 1 and 8 and investigator’s choice of cisplatin or carboplatin on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Among patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab and enfortumab vedotin, the median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab was 8.5 months (range: 9 days to 28.5 months). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.9% of patients treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin including acute respiratory failure (0.7%), pneumonia (0.5%), and pneumonitis/ILD (0.2%).

Patients with autoimmune disease or medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications were ineligible [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or either radiographic or clinical disease progression. The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab was 2.8 months (range: 1 day to 15.8 months). Intravenous pembrolizumab was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 11% of patients. Eighteen patients (5%) died from causes other than disease progression. Five patients (1.4%) who were treated with intravenous pembrolizumab experienced sepsis which led to death, and three patients (0.8%) experienced pneumonia which led to death. Adverse reactions leading to interruption of intravenous pembrolizumab occurred in 22% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were liver enzyme increase, diarrhea, urinary tract infection, acute kidney injury, fatigue, joint pain, and pneumonia.

Adjuvant treatment of RCC The safety of intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent was investigated in KEYNOTE-564, a randomized (1:1) double-blind placebo-controlled trial in which 984 patients who had undergone nephrectomy for RCC received 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (n=488) or placebo (n=496) for up to one year [see Clinical Studies (14.15) ] . The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab was 11.1 months (range: 1 day to 14.3 months). Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 20% of these patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab. Serious adverse reactions (≥1%) were acute kidney injury, adrenal insufficiency, pneumonia, colitis, and diabetic ketoacidosis (1% each). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 0.2% of those treated with intravenous pembrolizumab, including one case of pneumonia. Discontinuation of intravenous pembrolizumab due to an adverse reaction occurred in 21% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were increased ALT (1.6%), colitis (1%), and adrenal insufficiency (1%). Dose interruptions of intravenous pembrolizumab due to an adverse reaction occurred in 26% of patients; the most common (≥1%) were increased AST (2.3%), arthralgia (1.6%), hypothyroidism (1.6%), diarrhea (1.4%), increased ALT (1.4%), fatigue (1.4%), rash, decreased appetite, and vomiting (1% each).

A total of 759 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks and chemotherapy for 6 cycles followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 400 mg every 6 weeks for up to 14 cycles (n=382) or placebo and chemotherapy for 6 cycles followed by placebo for up to 14 cycles (n=377). The median duration of exposure to intravenous pembrolizumab was 5.6 months (range: 1 day to 24.0 months). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, compared to 19% of patients receiving placebo in combination with chemotherapy. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.6% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, including COVID-19 (0.5%), and cardiac arrest (0.3%). Intravenous pembrolizumab was discontinued for an adverse reaction in 14% of patients. Chemotherapy dose reduction was required in 29% of patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, compared to 23% of patients receiving placebo in combination with chemotherapy. There were no clinically meaningful differences in chemotherapy discontinuations or interruptions between arms. Adverse reactions occurring in patients treated with intravenous pembrolizumab and chemotherapy were generally similar to those observed with intravenous pembrolizumab alone or chemotherapy alone with the exception of rash (33% all Grades; 2.9% Grades 3-4). In Combination with Lenvatinib for the Treatment of Advanced Endometrial Carcinoma That Is pMMR or Not MSI-H.

        "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on its mechanism of action [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] , KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available human data informing the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity. In animal models, the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway is important in the maintenance of pregnancy through induction of maternal immune tolerance to fetal tissue (see Data ) . Human IgG4 (immunoglobulins) are known to cross the placenta; therefore, pembrolizumab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing fetus. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data KEYTRUDA QLEX for subcutaneous injection contains pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa [see Description (11) ] . Pembrolizumab: Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with pembrolizumab to evaluate its effect on reproduction and fetal development. A literature-based assessment of the effects of the PD-1 pathway on reproduction demonstrated that a central function of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is to preserve pregnancy by maintaining maternal immune tolerance to the fetus. Blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the fetus and to result in an increase in fetal loss; therefore, potential risks of administering pembrolizumab during pregnancy include increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. As reported in the literature, there were no malformations related to the blockade of PD-1 signaling in the offspring of these animals; however, immune-mediated disorders occurred in PD-1 knockout mice. Based on its mechanism of action, fetal exposure to pembrolizumab may increase the risk of developing immune-mediated disorders or of altering the normal immune response. Berahyaluronidase alfa: In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rabbits were administered daily subcutaneous injections of 138,600, 403,200, or 1,209,600 U/kg berahyaluronidase alfa during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 19). Berahyaluronidase alfa caused delayed fetal development at doses ≥403,200 U/kg, which is >2,500 times higher than the human dose (U/kg basis). Increased post-implantation loss and visceral malformations (supernumerary fissure lung lobe) were observed at 1,209,600 U/kg, which is >7,500 times higher than the human dose. In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, there were no adverse embryo-fetal findings in pregnant animals administered daily subcutaneous injections of berahyaluronidase alfa at doses up to 2,520,000 U/kg (>15,000 times higher than the human dose) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17). In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, pregnant animals were administered daily subcutaneous injections of 280,000, 840,000, or 2,520,000 U/kg berahyaluronidase alfa from implantation through lactation and weaning (gestation day 6 to lactation day 21). There were no adverse effects on sexual maturation, learning and memory, or fertility of the offspring at doses up to 2,520,000 U/kg, which is >15,000 times higher than the human dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of pembrolizumab or berahyaluronidase alfa in either animal or human milk or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Maternal IgG is known to be present in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed child to KEYTRUDA QLEX are unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in breastfed children, advise women not to breastfeed during treatment with KEYTRUDA QLEX and for 4 months after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on its mechanism of action, KEYTRUDA QLEX can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating KEYTRUDA QLEX [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Contraception Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with KEYTRUDA QLEX and for 4 months after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA QLEX for the treatment of pediatric patients 12 years and older who weigh greater than 40 kg have been established for: Stage IIB, IIC, or III melanoma following complete resection [see Indications and Usage (1.1) ] Unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) solid tumors [see Indications and Usage (1.6) ] Recurrent locally advanced or metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma [see Indications and Usage (1.13) ] Unresectable or metastatic tumor mutational burden high solid tumors (TMB-H) [see Indications and Usage (1.16) ] Use of KEYTRUDA QLEX in pediatric patients for these indications is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of intravenous pembrolizumab in adults and additional pharmacokinetic and safety data for intravenous pembrolizumab in pediatric patients 12 years and older [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Studies (14) ]. Pembrolizumab exposures in pediatric patients 12 years and older who weigh greater than 40 kg are predicted to be within range of those observed in adults at the same dosage [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA QLEX have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 12 years of age for the treatment of melanoma, MCC, MSI-H or dMMR cancer, and TMB-H cancer. The safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA QLEX have not been established in pediatric patients for other approved indications [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Intravenous pembrolizumab In KEYNOTE-051, 173 pediatric patients (including 108 pediatric patients aged 12 to 17 years) with advanced melanoma, lymphoma, or PD-L1 positive or MSI-H solid tumors received intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The median duration of exposure was 2.1 months (range: 1 day to 25 months). Adverse reactions that occurred at a ≥10% higher rate in pediatric patients when compared to adults included pyrexia (33%), vomiting (29%), headache (25%), abdominal pain (23%), decreased lymphocyte count (13%), and decreased white blood cell count (11%). Laboratory abnormalities that occurred at a ≥10% higher rate in pediatric patients when compared to adults were leukopenia (30%), neutropenia (28%), thrombocytopenia (22%), and Grade 3 anemia (17%). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 251 patients treated with KEYTRUDA QLEX in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy in Study MK-3745A-D77, 53% were 65 years and older and 16% were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness of KEYTRUDA QLEX have been observed between patients aged 65 years or older and younger adult patients. The safety of KEYTRUDA QLEX as monotherapy or in combination with other antineoplastic drugs for its approved indications [see Indications and Usage (1) ] has been established in adequate and well-controlled studies of intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent and in combination with other antineoplastic drugs. Below is a description of geriatric use information from the intravenous pembrolizumab studies. Of 3781 patients with melanoma, NSCLC, HNSCC, or urothelial carcinoma who were treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in clinical studies, 48% were 65 years and over and 17% were 75 years and over. Of 506 adult patients with Stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC following complete resection and platinum-based chemotherapy who were treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-091, 242 (48%) were 65 years and over. Of 596 adult patients with TNBC who were treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel, paclitaxel protein-bound, or gemcitabine and carboplatin in KEYNOTE-355, 137 (23%) were 65 years and over. Of 406 adult patients with endometrial carcinoma who were treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib in KEYNOTE-775, 201 (50%) were 65 years and over. Of the 564 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin, 44% (n=247) were 65-74 years and 26% (n=144) were 75 years or older. No overall differences in effectiveness were observed between patients 65 years of age or older and younger patients. Patients 75 years of age or older treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 4% in patients younger than 75 and 7% in patients 75 years or older. Of the 167 patients with MIBC treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin, 37% (n=61) were 65-74 years and 46% (n=77) were 75 years or older. Patients 75 years of age or older treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin experienced a higher incidence of fatal adverse reactions than younger patients. The incidence of fatal adverse reactions was 4% in patients younger than 75 and 12% in patients 75 years or older. Of the 432 patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib in the KEYNOTE-426 trial, 40% were 65 years or older. Of 294 adult patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA cervical cancer who were treated with intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with CRT in KEYNOTE-A18, 42 (14%) were 65 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between intravenous pembrolizumab-treated patients aged 65 years or older and younger adult patients."

Berahyaluronidase alfa: In an embryo-fetal development study, pregnant rabbits were administered daily subcutaneous injections of 138,600, 403,200, or 1,209,600 U/kg berahyaluronidase alfa during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 19). Berahyaluronidase alfa caused delayed fetal development at doses ≥403,200 U/kg, which is >2,500 times higher than the human dose (U/kg basis). Increased post-implantation loss and visceral malformations (supernumerary fissure lung lobe) were observed at 1,209,600 U/kg, which is >7,500 times higher than the human dose. In an embryo-fetal development study in rats, there were no adverse embryo-fetal findings in pregnant animals administered daily subcutaneous injections of berahyaluronidase alfa at doses up to 2,520,000 U/kg (>15,000 times higher than the human dose) during the period of organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17). In a pre- and post-natal development study in rats, pregnant animals were administered daily subcutaneous injections of 280,000, 840,000, or 2,520,000 U/kg berahyaluronidase alfa from implantation through lactation and weaning (gestation day 6 to lactation day 21). There were no adverse effects on sexual maturation, learning and memory, or fertility of the offspring at doses up to 2,520,000 U/kg, which is >15,000 times higher than the human dose."

        "11 DESCRIPTION KEYTRUDA QLEX is a fixed-combination drug product containing pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa. Pembrolizumab is a programmed death receptor-1 (PD 1)-blocking antibody. Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG4 kappa antibody with an approximate molecular weight of 149 kDa. Pembrolizumab is produced in recombinant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Berahyaluronidase alfa is an endoglycosidase used to enhance dispersion and permeation, which facilitates delivery of increased volume of pembrolizumab that is co-administered subcutaneously. It is produced by mammalian CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells containing a DNA plasmid encoding a variant of human hyaluronidase PH20. It is a glycosylated protein with an approximate molecular weight of 49 kDa under nonreducing, deglycosylated conditions. KEYTRUDA QLEX (pembrolizumab and berahyaluronidase alfa-pmph) injection is a sterile, preservative-free, clear to slightly opalescent, colorless to slightly yellow solution supplied in single-dose vials for subcutaneous administration. KEYTRUDA QLEX is supplied as two different configurations: Each KEYTRUDA QLEX 2.4 mL single-dose vial contains 395 mg of pembrolizumab and 4,800 units of berahyaluronidase alfa, and histidine (0.7 mg), histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (4.1 mg), methionine (3.6 mg), polysorbate 80 (0.5 mg), sucrose (168 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. The pH is 5.3-5.9. Each KEYTRUDA QLEX 4.8 mL single-dose vial contains 790 mg of pembrolizumab and 9,600 units of berahyaluronidase alfa, and histidine (1.4 mg), histidine hydrochloride monohydrate (8.2 mg), methionine (7.2 mg), polysorbate 80 (1 mg), sucrose (336 mg), and Water for Injection, USP. The pH is 5.3-5.9."

        "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Binding of the PD-1 ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, to the PD-1 receptor found on T cells, inhibits T cell proliferation and cytokine production. Upregulation of PD-1 ligands occurs in some tumors and signaling through this pathway can contribute to inhibition of active T-cell immune surveillance of tumors. Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumor growth. In syngeneic mouse tumor models, combination treatment of a PD-1 blocking antibody and kinase inhibitor lenvatinib decreased tumor-associated macrophages, increased activated cytotoxic T cells, and reduced tumor growth compared to either treatment alone. Berahyaluronidase alfa, an endoglycosidase, is a variant of human hyaluronidase PH20 that temporarily and locally breaks down hyaluronan. Hyaluronan is a polysaccharide found in the extracellular matrix of the subcutaneous tissue. Unlike the stable structural components of the interstitial matrix, hyaluronan has a half-life of approximately 0.5 days. Hyaluronidase increases permeability of the subcutaneous tissue by depolymerizing hyaluronan. In the doses administered, the effects of berahyaluronidase alfa are reversible and permeability of the subcutaneous tissue is restored within 24 to 48 hours. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics There are no clinically significant exposure-response relationships for efficacy or safety for intravenous pembrolizumab across the approved dosing regimens, regardless of cancer type. The exposures from subcutaneous KEYTRUDA QLEX doses of 395 mg/4,800 units every 3 weeks or 790 mg/9,600 units every 6 weeks are within the range of exposures from intravenous pembrolizumab doses. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics were characterized at Cycle 1 and at steady state in patients with advanced solid tumors at the approved recommended dosages and are presented as mean (CV%) unless otherwise specified. When comparing pembrolizumab exposure following subcutaneous administration every 6 weeks to that of intravenous administration every 6 weeks in Study MK-3475A-D77 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], the geometric mean ratio (GMR) for Cycle 1 AUC 0-6wks was 1.14 (96% CI: 1.06, 1.22) and Cycle 3 C trough (i.e., steady state) was 1.67 (94% CI: 1.52, 1.84). Pembrolizumab steady state was reached by 16 weeks. At steady state following subcutaneous administration, the mean pembrolizumab AUC 0-6wks was 2,798 mcg•day/mL for the every 6 week dosing and pembrolizumab AUC 0-3wks was 1,343 mcg•day/mL for the every 3 week dosing. Pembrolizumab C trough was 39 mcg/mL for the every 6 week dosing and 49 mcg/mL for the every 3 week dosing. The systemic accumulation ratio was 1.6-fold following administration of KEYTRUDA QLEX 790 mg/9,600 units every 6 weeks and 2.5-fold following administration of KEYTRUDA QLEX 395 mg/4,800 units every 3 weeks. Absorption Pembrolizumab bioavailability (CV%) is approximately 60% (14%). Peak concentrations occurred by approximately 4 days. Distribution The volume of distribution is 6 L. Elimination Pembrolizumab clearance decreases over time, resulting in a steady state clearance (CV%) of - 195 mL/day (40%); this decrease in clearance with time is not considered clinically significant. The terminal half-life is 22 days. Specific Populations No clinically significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab were observed based on age (37 to 87 years), race (63% White, 28% Asian, 3% Black), sex, body weight (37 to 144 kg), tumor type, injection site (thigh or abdomen), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and mild to moderate hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤3 times ULN and any AST). The effect of severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 times ULN and any AST) on pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics is unknown. Pediatric Patients Pembrolizumab exposures in pediatric patients 12 years and older who weigh greater than 40 kg are predicted to be within range of those observed in adult patients at the same dosage. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of ADA in the studies described in this section with the incidence of ADA in other studies, including those of KEYTRUDA QLEX or of other pembrolizumab products or berahyaluronidase alfa products. With a median (min, max) duration of treatment on KEYTRUDA QLEX of 6.9 months (1 day, 1 year) in Study MK-3475A-D77, 1.4% (3/211) of patients developed anti-pembrolizumab antibodies, and one ADA-positive patient developed neutralizing antibodies (NAb) against pembrolizumab. The incidence of anti-berahyaluronidase alfa antibodies was 1.5% (3/194). No analysis of neutralizing antibodies was performed for berahyaluronidase alfa ADA-positive samples. Because of the low occurrence of anti-pembrolizumab or anti-berahyaluronidase antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, safety and effectiveness of KEYTRUDA QLEX is unknown."

In 1-month and 6-month repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the male and female reproductive organs; however, most animals in these studies were not sexually mature. Berahyaluronidase alfa Hyaluronidases are found in most tissues of the body. Long-term animal studies have not been performed to assess the carcinogenic or mutagenic potential of berahyaluronidase alfa. In a fertility and early embryonic development study, male and female rats were administered daily subcutaneous injections of 280,000, 840,000, or 2,520,000 U/kg berahyaluronidase alfa. Males were dosed for 9 weeks prior to mating and throughout mating to termination. Females were dosed for 2 weeks prior to mating, throughout mating, and up to gestation day 7. Although treatment with ≥840,000 U/kg berahyaluronidase alfa (>5,200 times higher than the human dose) resulted in an increased incidence of abnormal sperm morphology, there were no adverse effects on mating, fertility or embryogenesis observed at doses up to 2,520,000 U/kg (>15,000 times higher than the human dose). 13.2 Animal Toxicology and/or Pharmacology In animal models, inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 signaling increased the severity of some infections and enhanced inflammatory responses. Mycobacterium tuberculosis -infected PD-1 knockout mice exhibit markedly decreased survival compared with wild-type controls, which correlated with increased bacterial proliferation and inflammatory responses in these animals. PD-1 blockade using a primate anti-PD-1 antibody was also shown to exacerbate M. tuberculosis infection in rhesus macaques. PD-1 and PD-L1 knockout mice and mice receiving PD-L1-blocking antibody have also shown decreased survival following infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. Administration of pembrolizumab in chimpanzees with naturally occurring chronic hepatitis B infection resulted in two out of four animals with significantly increased levels of serum ALT, AST, and GGT, which persisted for at least 1 month after discontinuation of pembrolizumab."

        "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 KEYTRUDA QLEX NSCLC (Study MK-3475A-D77) KEYTRUDA QLEX was evaluated in Study MK-3475A-D77 (NCT05722015), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in patients with treatment-naïve metastatic NSCLC, in whom there were no EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 genomic tumor aberrations. Patients were excluded if they had a history of autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; had a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks. A total of 377 patients were randomized (2:1) to receive either KEYTRUDA QLEX (containing 790 mg pembrolizumab and 9,600 units berahyaluronidase alfa) administered subcutaneously every 6 weeks with platinum doublet chemotherapy (n=251) or pembrolizumab 400 mg intravenously every 6 weeks with platinum doublet chemotherapy (n=126). The chemotherapy regimens were as follows: Non-squamous NSCLC: pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 and a platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min) intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Squamous NSCLC: carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min and a taxane (paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle or paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle) intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Randomization was stratified by ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1), histology (squamous vs. non-squamous), PD-L1 TPS (<50% vs. ≥50%), and geographic region (East Asia vs. North America/Western Europe/Australia/New Zealand vs. Rest of the World). Treatment with KEYTRUDA QLEX or intravenous pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 18 cycles (approximately 24 months). Administration of KEYTRUDA QLEX or intravenous pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression by BICR or beyond discontinuation of pemetrexed if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. The primary outcome measure was pembrolizumab exposure [Cycle 1 AUC 0-6 weeks and Cycle 3 (i.e., Steady State) C trough ] of subcutaneous KEYTRUDA QLEX as compared to intravenous pembrolizumab [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Additional descriptive efficacy outcome measures were overall response rate (ORR) by blinded independent central review (BICR), progression-free survival (PFS) by BICR, and overall survival (OS). The study population characteristics were: median age 65 years (range: 37 to 87); 71% male; 63% White, 29% Asian, 4% multiracial, 3% Black or African American, 2% American Indian or Alaska Native; 31% of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity; 35% ECOG performance status (PS) of 0 and 65% ECOG PS of 1. Nineteen percent had PD-L1 TPS ≥50%; 34% had tumors with squamous histology and 66% had tumors with non-squamous histology; and 9% had brain metastases at baseline. At the primary analysis, the confirmed ORR was 45% (95% CI: 39, 52) in the subcutaneous KEYTRUDA QLEX arm and 42% (95% CI: 33, 51) in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm. There were no notable differences in PFS or OS observed in patients who received KEYTRUDA QLEX compared to patients who received intravenous pembrolizumab. Intravenous Pembrolizumab The effectiveness of KEYTRUDA QLEX for its approved indications [see Indications and Usage (1) ] has been established based upon the evidence from the adequate and well-controlled studies conducted with intravenous pembrolizumab [see Clinical Studies (14.2 - 14.19) ] and additional data that demonstrated comparable pharmacokinetic, efficacy, and safety profiles between KEYTRUDA QLEX and intravenous pembrolizumab in Study MK-3475A-D77 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Below is a description of the efficacy results of these adequate and well-controlled studies of intravenous pembrolizumab in these patient populations. 14.2 Melanoma Ipilimumab-Naive Melanoma The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-006 (NCT01866319), a randomized (1:1:1), open-label, multicenter, active-controlled trial in 834 patients. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous pembrolizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or to ipilimumab 3 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks for 4 doses unless discontinued earlier for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with disease progression could receive additional doses of treatment unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging. Randomization was stratified by line of therapy (0 vs. 1), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and PD-L1 expression (≥1% of tumor cells [positive] vs. <1% of tumor cells [negative]) according to an investigational use only (IUO) assay. Key eligibility criteria were unresectable or metastatic melanoma; no prior ipilimumab; and no more than one prior systemic treatment for metastatic melanoma. Patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive melanoma were not required to have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. Patients with autoimmune disease; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; previous severe hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies; and HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, were ineligible. Assessment of tumor status was performed at 12 weeks, then every 6 weeks through Week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS; as assessed by blinded independent central review [BICR] using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ]). Additional efficacy outcome measures were objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DoR). The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 18 to 89); 60% male; 98% White; 66% had no prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease; 69% ECOG PS of 0; 80% had PD-L1 positive melanoma, 18% had PD-L1 negative melanoma, and 2% had unknown PD-L1 status using the IUO assay; 65% had M1c stage disease; 68% with normal LDH; 36% with reported BRAF mutation-positive melanoma; and 9% with a history of brain metastases. Among patients with BRAF mutation-positive melanoma, 139 (46%) were previously treated with a BRAF inhibitor. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and PFS for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab as compared to ipilimumab. Among the 91 patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.4+ to 8.1+ months. Among the 94 patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.4+ to 8.2 months. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 57 and Figure 1.

The treatment arms consisted of intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens: dacarbazine 1000 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (26%), temozolomide 200 mg/m 2 orally once daily for 5 days every 28 days (25%), carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min intravenously plus paclitaxel 225 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks for four cycles then carboplatin AUC of 5 mg/mL/min plus paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks (25%), paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks (16%), or carboplatin AUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks (8%). Randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), LDH levels (normal vs. elevated [≥110% ULN]) and BRAF V600 mutation status (wild-type [WT] or V600E). The trial included patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with progression of disease; refractory to two or more doses of ipilimumab (3 mg/kg or higher) and, if BRAF V600 mutation-positive, a BRAF or MEK inhibitor; and disease progression within 24 weeks following the last dose of ipilimumab. The trial excluded patients with uveal melanoma and active brain metastasis. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab until unacceptable toxicity; disease progression that was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging; withdrawal of consent; or physician's decision to stop therapy for the patient. Assessment of tumor status was performed at 12 weeks after randomization, then every 6 weeks through week 48, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. Patients on chemotherapy who experienced progression of disease were offered intravenous pembrolizumab. The major efficacy outcomes were PFS as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were confirmed ORR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and DoR. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 15 to 89), 43% age 65 or older; 61% male; 98% White; and 55% ECOG PS of 0 and 45% ECOG PS of 1. Twenty-three percent of patients were BRAF V600 mutation positive, 40% had elevated LDH at baseline, 82% had M1c disease, and 73% had two or more prior therapies for advanced or metastatic disease. The study demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab as compared to control arm. There was no statistically significant difference between intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg and chemotherapy or between intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg and chemotherapy in the OS analysis in which 55% of the patients who had been randomized to receive chemotherapy had crossed over to receive intravenous pembrolizumab. Among the 38 patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.3+ to 11.5+ months. Among the 46 patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg with an objective response, response durations ranged from 1.1+ to 11.1+ months. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 58 and Figure 2.

Patients were randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg or the pediatric (≥12 years old) dose of intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg intravenously (up to a maximum of 200 mg) every three weeks or placebo for up to one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by AJCC 8 th edition T Stage (>2.0-4.0 mm with ulceration vs. >4.0 mm without ulceration vs. >4.0 mm with ulceration). Patients must not have been previously treated for melanoma beyond complete surgical resection for their melanoma prior to study entry. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS) (defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence [local, in-transit or regional lymph nodes or distant recurrence] or death, whichever occurred first). New primary melanomas were excluded from the definition of RFS. Distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), defined as a spread of tumor to distant organs or distant lymph nodes, was an additional efficacy outcome measure. Patients underwent imaging every six months for one year from randomization, every 6 months from years 2 to 4, and then once in year 5 from randomization or until recurrence, whichever came first. The study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range: 16 to 87), 39% age 65 or older; 60% male; 98% White; and 93% ECOG PS of 0 and 7% ECOG PS of 1. Sixty-four percent had Stage IIB and 35% had Stage IIC. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in RFS and DMFS for patients randomized to the intravenous pembrolizumab arm compared with placebo. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 59 and Figure 3.

Figure 3: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Recurrence-Free Survival in KEYNOTE-716 Adjuvant Treatment of Stage III Resected Melanoma The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-054 (NCT02362594), a multicenter, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with completely resected Stage IIIA (>1 mm lymph node metastasis), IIIB, or IIIC melanoma. Patients were randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every three weeks or placebo for up to one year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by American Joint Committee on Cancer 7 th edition (AJCC) stage (IIIA vs. IIIB vs. IIIC 1-3 positive lymph nodes vs. IIIC ≥4 positive lymph nodes) and geographic region (North America, European countries, Australia, and other countries as designated). Patients must have undergone lymph node dissection and, if indicated, radiotherapy within 13 weeks prior to starting treatment. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the whole population and in the population with PD-L1 positive tumors where RFS was defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first recurrence (local, regional, or distant metastasis) or death, whichever occurs first. New primary melanomas were excluded from the definition of RFS. DMFS in the whole population and in the population with PD-L1 positive tumors were additional efficacy outcome measures. DMFS was defined as a spread of tumor to distant organs or distant lymph nodes. Patients underwent imaging every 12 weeks after the first dose of intravenous pembrolizumab for the first two years, then every 6 months from year 3 to 5, and then annually. The study population characteristics were: median age of 54 years (range: 19 to 88), 25% age 65 or older; 62% male; and 94% ECOG PS of 0 and 6% ECOG PS of 1. Sixteen percent had Stage IIIA, 46% had Stage IIIB, 18% had Stage IIIC (1-3 positive lymph nodes), and 20% had Stage IIIC (≥4 positive lymph nodes); 50% were BRAF V600 mutation positive and 44% were BRAF wild-type; and 84% had PD-L1 positive melanoma with TPS ≥1% according to an IUO assay. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in RFS and DMFS for patients randomized to the intravenous pembrolizumab arm compared with placebo. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 60 and Figure 4.

For patients with PD-L1 positive tumors, the RFS HR was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.69); p<0.0001. For patients with PD-L1 positive tumors, the DMFS HR was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.76); p<0.0001. The RFS and DMFS benefit for intravenous pembrolizumab compared to placebo was observed regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Figure 4: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Recurrence-Free Survival in KEYNOTE-054 Figure 3 Figure 4 14.3 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer First-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy was investigated in KEYNOTE-189 (NCT02578680), a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active-controlled trial conducted in 616 patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status, who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease and in whom there were no EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by smoking status (never vs. former/current), choice of platinum (cisplatin vs. carboplatin), and tumor PD-L1 status (TPS <1% [negative] vs. TPS ≥1%). Patients were randomized (2:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg, pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 , and investigator's choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg and pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Placebo, pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 , and investigator's choice of cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles followed by placebo and pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of intravenous pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Patients randomized to placebo and chemotherapy were offered intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent at the time of disease progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed at Week 6, Week 12, and then every 9 weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR, as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 34 to 84), 49% age 65 or older; 59% male; 94% White and 3% Asian; 56% ECOG PS of 1; and 18% with history of brain metastases. Thirty-one percent had tumor PD-L1 expression TPS <1% [negative]. Seventy-two percent received carboplatin and 12% were never smokers. A total of 85 patients in the placebo and chemotherapy arm received an anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy compared with placebo, pemetrexed, and platinum chemotherapy.

Figure 5: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival in KEYNOTE-189 Based on the protocol-specified final OS analysis Figure 5 First-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound chemotherapy The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and investigator's choice of either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound was investigated in KEYNOTE-407 (NCT02775435), a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 559 patients with metastatic squamous NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status, who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 status (TPS <1% [negative] vs. TPS ≥1%), choice of paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound, and geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms; all study medications were administered via intravenous infusion: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles, and paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles or paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. Placebo and carboplatin AUC 6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles and paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles or paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles, followed by placebo every 3 weeks. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab and chemotherapy or placebo and chemotherapy continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of disease as determined by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of intravenous pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. Patients randomized to the placebo and chemotherapy arm were offered intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent at the time of disease progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 6 weeks through Week 18, every 9 weeks through Week 45 and every 12 weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measures were PFS and ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and OS. An additional efficacy outcome measure was DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 65 years (range: 29 to 88), 55% age 65 or older; 81% male; 77% White; 71% ECOG PS of 1; and 8% with a history of brain metastases. Thirty-five percent had tumor PD-L1 expression TPS <1%; 19% were from the East Asian region; and 60% received paclitaxel. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS, PFS and ORR in patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound chemotherapy compared with patients randomized to placebo with carboplatin and either paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound chemotherapy.

Figure 6: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival in KEYNOTE-407 Based on the protocol-specified final OS analysis Figure 6 First-line treatment of metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥1%) as a single agent KEYNOTE-042 The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-042 (NCT02220894), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 1274 patients with Stage III NSCLC who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation, or patients with metastatic NSCLC. Only patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 (TPS ≥1%) by an immunohistochemistry assay using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit and who had not received prior systemic treatment for metastatic NSCLC were eligible. Patients with EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations; autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of radiation in the thoracic region within the prior 26 weeks of initiation of study were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), histology (squamous vs. nonsquamous), geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia), and PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥50% vs. TPS 1 to 49%). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of either of the following platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens: Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for a maximum of 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies; Paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for a maximum of 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of intravenous pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab could be reinitiated at the time of subsequent disease progression and administered for up to 12 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. The main efficacy outcome measure was OS in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% NSCLC, the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥20% NSCLC, and the overall population with TPS ≥1% NSCLC. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS and ORR in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% NSCLC, the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥20% NSCLC, and the overall population with TPS ≥1% NSCLC as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 25 to 90), 45% age 65 or older; 71% male; and 64% White, 30% Asian, and 2% Black. Nineteen percent were Hispanic or Latino. Sixty-nine percent had ECOG PS of 1; 39% with squamous and 61% with nonsquamous histology; 87% had M1 disease and 13% had Stage IIIA (2%) or Stage IIIB (11%) and who were not candidates for surgical resection or definitive chemoradiation per investigator assessment; and 5% with treated brain metastases at baseline. Forty-seven percent of patients had TPS ≥50% NSCLC and 53% had TPS 1 to 49% NSCLC. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients (PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, TPS ≥20%, TPS ≥1%) randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab as compared with chemotherapy. Table 63 and Figure 7 summarize the efficacy results in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% and in all randomized patients with TPS ≥1%.

In a pre-specified exploratory subgroup analysis for patients with TPS 1-49% NSCLC, the median OS was 13.4 months (95% CI: 10.7, 18.2) for the pembrolizumab group and 12.1 months (95% CI: 11.0, 14.0) in the chemotherapy group, with an HR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.77, 1.11). Figure 7: Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival in all Randomized Patients in KEYNOTE-042 (TPS ≥1%) Figure 7 KEYNOTE-024 The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was also investigated in KEYNOTE-024 (NCT02142738), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial in 305 previously untreated patients with metastatic NSCLC. The study design was similar to that of KEYNOTE-042, except that only patients whose tumors had high PD-L1 expression (TPS of 50% or greater) by an immunohistochemistry assay using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit were eligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of any of the following platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens: Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies; Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks for patients with nonsquamous histologies; Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m 2 on days 1 and 8 and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles; Gemcitabine 1250 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles; Paclitaxel 200 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks and carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 for 4 to 6 cycles followed by optional pemetrexed maintenance (for nonsquamous histologies). Patients randomized to chemotherapy were offered intravenous pembrolizumab at the time of disease progression. The main efficacy outcome measure was PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were OS and ORR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 65 years (range: 33 to 90), 54% age 65 or older; 61% male; 82% White and 15% Asian; 65% with ECOG PS of 1; 18% with squamous and 82% with nonsquamous histology and 9% with history of brain metastases. A total of 66 patients in the chemotherapy arm received intravenous pembrolizumab at the time of disease progression. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both PFS and OS for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab as compared with chemotherapy. Table 64 and Figure 8 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-024.

Figure 8 Previously treated NSCLC with PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥1%) The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-010 (NCT01905657), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 1033 patients with metastatic NSCLC that had progressed following platinum-containing chemotherapy, and if appropriate, targeted therapy for EGFR or ALK genomic tumor aberrations. Eligible patients had PD-L1 expression TPS of 1% or greater by an immunohistochemistry assay using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. Patients with autoimmune disease; a medical condition that required immunosuppression; or who had received more than 30 Gy of thoracic radiation within the prior 26 weeks were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression (PD-L1 expression TPS ≥50% vs. PD-L1 expression TPS=1-49%), ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), and geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia). Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks, intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks or docetaxel intravenously 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab were permitted to continue until disease progression that was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or confirmation of progression at 4 to 6 weeks with repeat imaging or for up to 24 months without disease progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% and the overall population with TPS ≥1%. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR in the subgroup of patients with TPS ≥50% and the overall population with TPS ≥1%. The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 20 to 88), 42% age 65 or older; 61% male; 72% White and 21% Asian; 66% ECOG PS of 1; 43% with high PD-L1 tumor expression; 21% with squamous, 70% with nonsquamous, and 8% with mixed, other or unknown histology; 91% metastatic (M1) disease; 15% with history of brain metastases; and 8% and 1% with EGFR and ALK genomic aberrations, respectively. All patients had received prior therapy with a platinum-doublet regimen, 29% received two or more prior therapies for their metastatic disease. Tables 65 and 66 and Figure 9 summarize efficacy results in the subgroup with TPS ≥50% population and in all patients, respectively.

Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, or a history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis that required steroids were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by stage (II vs. III), tumor PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥50% or <50%), histology (squamous vs. nonsquamous), and geographic region (East Asia vs. non-East Asia). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Treatment Arm A: neoadjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 and either pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 on Day 1 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for up to 4 cycles. Within 4-12 weeks following surgery, intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg was administered every 3 weeks for up to 13 cycles. Treatment Arm B: neoadjuvant placebo on Day 1 in combination with cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 and either pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 on Day 1 or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for up to 4 cycles. Within 4-12 weeks following surgery, placebo was administered every 3 weeks for up to 13 cycles. All study medications were administered via intravenous infusion. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab or placebo continued until completion of the treatment (17 cycles), disease progression that precluded definitive surgery, disease recurrence in the adjuvant phase, disease progression for those who did not undergo surgery or had incomplete resection and entered the adjuvant phase, or unacceptable toxicity. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline, Week 7, and Week 13 in the neoadjuvant phase and within 4 weeks prior to the start of the adjuvant phase. Following the start of the adjuvant phase, assessment of tumor status was performed every 16 weeks through the end of Year 3, and then every 6 months thereafter. The trial was not designed to isolate the effect of intravenous pembrolizumab in each phase (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) of treatment. The major efficacy outcome measures were OS and investigator-assessed event-free survival (EFS). Additional efficacy outcome measures were pathological complete response (pCR) rate and major pathological response (mPR) rate as assessed by blinded independent pathology review. The study population characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 26 to 83); 45% age 65 or older and 7% age 75 or older; 71% male; 61% White, 31% Asian, 2% Black, 4% race not reported; 9% Hispanic or Latino; 63% ECOG PS of 0 and 37% ECOG PS of 1. Thirty percent had Stage II and 70% had Stage III disease; 33% had TPS ≥50% and 67% had TPS <50%; 43% had tumors with squamous histology and 57% had tumors with non-squamous histology; 31% were from the East Asian region. Eighty-one percent of patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy arm received definitive surgery compared to 76% of patients in the placebo in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy arm. The trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and EFS for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent compared with patients randomized to placebo in combination with platinum-containing chemotherapy followed by placebo alone. Table 67 and Figure 10 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-671.

Adjuvant treatment of resected NSCLC The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-091 (NCT02504372), a multicenter, randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 1177 patients with completely resected Stage IB (T2a ≥4 cm), II, or IIIA NSCLC by AJCC 7th edition. Patients had not received neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy up to 4 cycles was optional. Patients were ineligible if they had active autoimmune disease, were on chronic immunosuppressive agents, or had a history of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis. Randomization was stratified by stage (IB vs. II vs. IIIA), receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (yes vs. no), PD-L1 status (TPS <1% [negative] vs. TPS 1-49% vs. TPS ≥50%), and geographic region (Western Europe vs. Eastern Europe vs. Asia vs. Rest of World). Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo intravenously every 3 weeks. Treatment continued until RECIST v1.1-defined disease recurrence as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity or up to one year. Tumor assessments were conducted every 12 weeks for the first year, then every 6 months for years 2 to 3, and then annually through year 5. After year 5, imaging was performed as per local standard of care. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS). An additional efficacy outcome measure was OS. Of 1177 patients randomized, 1010 (86%) received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy following resection. Among these 1010 patients, the median age was 64 years (range: 35 to 84), 49% age 65 or older; 68% male; 77% White, 18% Asian; 86% current or former smokers; and 39% with ECOG PS of 1. Eleven percent had Stage IB, 57% had Stage II, and 31% had Stage IIIA disease. Thirty-nine percent had PD-L1 TPS <1% [negative], 33% had TPS 1-49%, and 28% had TPS ≥50%. Fifty-two percent were from Western Europe, 20% from Eastern Europe, 17% from Asia, and 11% from Rest of World. The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in DFS in the overall population for patients randomized to the intravenous pembrolizumab arm compared to patients randomized to the placebo arm. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of the 167 patients (14%) who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, the DFS HR was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.76, 2.05). OS results were not mature with only 42% of pre-specified OS events in the overall population. Table 68 and Figure 11 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-091 in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy.

Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 3 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by histological subtype (epithelioid vs. non-epithelioid). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms; all study medications were administered via intravenous infusion: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg with pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5-6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks. Pemetrexed 500 mg/m 2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m 2 or carboplatin AUC 5-6 mg/mL/min on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for up to 6 cycles. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab continued until disease progression as determined by the investigator according to modified RECIST 1.1 for mesothelioma (mRECIST), unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 6 weeks for 18 weeks, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS, ORR, and DoR, as assessed by BICR according to mRECIST. The study population characteristics were: median age of 70 years (77% age 65 or older); 76% male; 79% White, 21% race not reported or unknown; 2% Hispanic or Latino; and 53% ECOG performance status of 1. Seventy-eight percent had epithelioid and 22% had non-epithelioid histology; 60% had tumors with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 and 30% had tumors with PD-L1 CPS <1. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS, PFS, and ORR in patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with patients randomized to chemotherapy alone.

In the subgroup of patients with non-epithelioid histology (n=95), the HR for OS was 0.57 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.89), with median OS of 12.3 months in intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy and 8.2 months in chemotherapy alone. Figure 12 14.5 Head and Neck Squamous Cell Cancer Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Treatment of Locally Advanced HNSCC for Tumors Expressing PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-689 (NCT02358031), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 714 patients with resectable locally advanced (Stage III-IVA) HNSCC [AJCC, 8th edition]. Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic therapy within two years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by primary tumor site (oropharynx/oral cavity vs. larynx vs. hypopharynx), tumor stage (III vs. IVA) and PD-L1 status (TPS ≥ 50% vs. TPS<50%) according to the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: neoadjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg for 2 cycles prior to surgical resection. Within 6 weeks following surgery, 3 cycles of adjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks in combination with radiotherapy (RT) with or without 3 cycles of cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks. This was followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks for up to 12 cycles. no neoadjuvant treatment prior to surgery. Within 6 weeks following surgery, adjuvant RT with or without 3 cycles of concurrent cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks. On both treatment arms, patients received cisplatin with adjuvant RT if high-risk pathological features (i.e., positive margins <1 mm or extranodal extension) were present at surgery. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab continued until disease progression by RECIST v1.1 per BICR during the neoadjuvant phase that precluded surgery, local or metastatic recurrence during the adjuvant phase, completion of treatment, or unacceptable toxicity. Assessment of tumor status was performed prior to surgery at Week 6 in the neoadjuvant phase. Following the start of the adjuvant phase, assessment of tumor status was performed 12 weeks after end of RT with or without cisplatin treatment and then every 3 months until the end of year 3; then every 6 months thereafter up to the end of year 5. The trial was not designed to isolate the effect of intravenous pembrolizumab in each phase (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) of treatment. The major efficacy outcome measure was event-free survival (EFS) by BICR defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes definitive surgery, local or distant disease progression or recurrence, or death due to any cause. Additional efficacy outcome measures were major pathological response (mPR) as assessed by BIPR, and overall survival (OS). The demographic and baseline characteristics in the 682 patients with PD-L1 expression of CPS ≥1 were: median age of 60 years (range: 22 to 87), 33% age 65 or older; 79% male; 78% White, 13% Asian and 2.5% Black or African American, 14% were Hispanic or Latino; 43% had ECOG PS of 1, and 79% were former/current smokers. Four percent of patients’ tumors were HPV-positive, and 26% had Stage III disease, 74% had Stage IVA disease. Sixty-eight percent of patients’ tumors had PD-L1 expression of CPS ≥10. Eighty-eight percent of patients received definitive surgery in both the intravenous pembrolizumab and the SOC arm. Seventy-six percent of patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm and 78% of patients in the SOC arm started the radiation phase of treatment. In the intravenous pembrolizumab arm, 35% of patients received intravenous pembrolizumab and cisplatin with concurrent RT, 57% of patients received intravenous pembrolizumab alone with concurrent RT, 3% of patients received cisplatin alone with concurrent RT, 5% of patients received RT alone and one patient (0.4%) received intravenous pembrolizumab alone without concurrent RT. On the SoC arm, 52% of patients received cisplatin with concurrent RT while 48% patients received RT alone. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in EFS for patients randomized to the intravenous pembrolizumab arm compared to those randomized to the standard of care (SOC) arm at the first pre-specified interim analysis.

Hypopharyngeal Tumors In an exploratory subgroup analysis of patients with PD-L1-positive (CPS ≥1) hypopharyngeal tumors who were randomized (n=51), the EFS HR was 2.28 (95% CI: 0.79, 6.56). Among these patients, 23 patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab arm received surgery, of which 17 patients (74%) had R0 resections. On the SOC arm, 23 patients received surgery, of which 20 (87%) had R0 resections. Oral Cavity, Oropharyngeal and Laryngeal Tumors In an exploratory subgroup analysis of patients with PD-L1 positive (CPS ≥1) oral cavity, oropharyngeal and laryngeal tumors who received surgery (n=555), 91% of patients on the intravenous pembrolizumab arm had R0 resections while 85% of patients on the SOC arm had R0 resections. First-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-048 (NCT02358031), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, active-controlled trial conducted in 882 patients with metastatic HNSCC who had not previously received systemic therapy for metastatic disease or with recurrent disease who were considered incurable by local therapies. Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression (TPS ≥50% or <50%) according to the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit, HPV status according to p16 IHC (positive or negative), and ECOG PS (0 vs. 1). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following treatment arms: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks, and FU 1000 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 96 hours every 3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and FU) Cetuximab 400 mg/m 2 intravenously as the initial dose then 250 mg/m 2 intravenously once weekly, carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min intravenously every 3 weeks or cisplatin 100 mg/m 2 intravenously every 3 weeks, and FU 1000 mg/m 2 /day as a continuous intravenous infusion over 96 hours every 3 weeks (maximum of 6 cycles of platinum and FU) Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of intravenous pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed at Week 9 and then every 6 weeks for the first year, followed by every 9 weeks through 24 months. A retrospective re-classification of patients' tumor PD-L1 status according to CPS using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit was conducted using the tumor specimens used for randomization. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ) sequentially tested in the subgroup of patients with CPS ≥20, the subgroup of patients with CPS ≥1, and the overall population. The study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range: 20 to 94), 36% age 65 or older; 83% male; 73% White, 20% Asian and 2.4% Black; 61% had ECOG PS of 1; and 79% were former/current smokers. Twenty-two percent of patients' tumors were HPV-positive, 23% had PD-L1 TPS ≥50%, and 95% had Stage IV disease (Stage IVA 19%, Stage IVB 6%, and Stage IVC 70%). Eighty-five percent of patients' tumors had PD-L1 expression of CPS ≥1 and 43% had CPS ≥20. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to those randomized to cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy at a pre-specified interim analysis in the overall population. Table 71 and Figure 14 summarize efficacy results for intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy.

First-line treatment of metastatic or unresectable, recurrent HNSCC for Tumors Expressing PD-L1 (CPS ≥1) as a single agent The trial also demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS for the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent compared to those randomized to cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy at a pre-specified interim analysis. At the time of the interim and final analyses, there was no significant difference in OS between the intravenous pembrolizumab single agent arm and the control arm for the overall population. Table 72 summarizes efficacy results for intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent in the subgroups of patients with CPS ≥1 HNSCC and CPS ≥20 HNSCC. Figure 15 summarizes the OS results in the subgroup of patients with CPS ≥1 HNSCC.

Figure 13 Figure 14 Figure 15 Previously treated recurrent or metastatic HNSCC The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-012 (NCT01848834), a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort study that enrolled 174 patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC who had disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy administered for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC or following platinum-containing chemotherapy administered as part of induction, concurrent, or adjuvant therapy. Patients with active autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, evidence of interstitial lung disease, or ECOG PS ≥2 were ineligible. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks (n=53) or 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=121) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months. Treatment with pembrolizumab could be reinitiated for subsequent disease progression and administered for up to 1 additional year. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 8 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR, and DoR. The study population characteristics were median age of 60 years, 32% age 65 or older; 82% male; 75% White, 16% Asian, and 6% Black; 87% had M1 disease; 33% had HPV positive tumors; 63% had prior cetuximab; 29% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 71% had an ECOG PS of 1; and the median number of prior lines of therapy administered for the treatment of HNSCC was 2. The ORR was 16% (95% CI: 11, 22) with a complete response rate of 5%. The median follow-up time was 8.9 months. Among the 28 responding patients, the median DoR had not been reached (range: 2.4+ to 27.7+ months), with 23 patients having responses of 6 months or longer. The ORR and DoR were similar irrespective of dosage regimen (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 200 mg every 3 weeks) or HPV status. 14.6 Urothelial Cancer In Combination with Enfortumab Vedotin for the Treatment of Patients with Urothelial Cancer The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin was evaluated in KEYNOTE-A39 (NCT04223856), an open-label, randomized, multicenter trial that enrolled 886 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who received no prior systemic therapy for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Patients with active CNS metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy Grade ≥2, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms were excluded. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg over 30 minutes on Day 1 and enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. Intravenous pembrolizumab was given approximately 30 minutes after enfortumab vedotin. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. In the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, intravenous pembrolizumab was continued for up to 2 years. Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle with cisplatin 70 mg/m 2 or carboplatin (AUC = 4.5 or 5) on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle. Treatment was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for up to 6 cycles. Randomization was stratified by cisplatin eligibility, PD-L1 expression, and presence of liver metastases. The median age was 69 years (range: 22 to 91); 77% were male; 67% were White, 22% were Asian, 1% were Black or African American, and 10% were unknown or other; 12% were Hispanic or Latino. Patients had a baseline ECOG performance status of 0 (49%), 1 (47%), or 2 (3%). Forty-seven percent of patients had a documented baseline HbA1c of <5.7%. At baseline, 95% of patients had metastatic urothelial cancer, including 72% with visceral and 22% with liver metastases, and 5% had locally advanced urothelial cancer. Eighty-five percent of patients had urothelial carcinoma (UC) histology including 6% with UC mixed squamous differentiation and 2% with UC mixed other histologic variants. Forty-six percent of patients were considered cisplatin-ineligible and 54% were considered cisplatin-eligible at time of randomization. The major efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR as assessed by BICR. The trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS, PFS, and ORR for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin as compared to platinum-based chemotherapy. Efficacy results were consistent across all stratified patient subgroups. Table 73 and Figures 16 and 17 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-A39.

Patients with active CNS metastases, ongoing sensory or motor neuropathy Grade ≥2, or uncontrolled diabetes defined as hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥8% or HbA1c ≥7% with associated diabetes symptoms were excluded from participating in the study. Patients in the dose escalation cohort (n=5), Cohort A (n=40), and Cohort K (n=76) received enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg as an IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg as an IV infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle approximately 30 minutes after enfortumab vedotin. Patients were treated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 121 patients received intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin. The median age was 71 years (range: 51 to 91); 74% were male; 85% were White, 5% were Black, 4% were Asian and 6% were other, unknown or not reported. Ten percent of patients were Hispanic or Latino. Forty-five percent of patients had an ECOG performance status of 1 and 15% had an ECOG performance status of 2. Forty-seven percent of patients had a documented baseline HbA1c of <5.7%. Reasons for cisplatin-ineligibility included: 60% with baseline creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min, 10% with ECOG PS of 2, 13% with Grade 2 or greater hearing loss, and 16% with more than one cisplatin-ineligibility criteria. At baseline, 97.5% of patients had metastatic urothelial cancer and 2.5% of patients had locally advanced urothelial cancer. Thirty-seven percent of patients had upper tract disease. Eighty-four percent of patients had visceral metastasis at baseline, including 22% with liver metastases. Thirty-nine percent of patients had TCC histology; 13% had TCC with squamous differentiation, and 48% had TCC with other histologic variants. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1. The median follow-up time for the dose escalation cohort + Cohort A was 44.7 months (range 0.7 to 52.4) and for Cohort K was 14.8 months (range: 0.6 to 26.2). Efficacy results are presented in Table 74 below. Table 74: Efficacy Results in KEYNOTE-869, Combined Dose Escalation Cohort, Cohort A, and Cohort K Endpoint Intravenous Pembrolizumab in combination with Enfortumab Vedotin n=121 Confirmed ORR (95% CI) 68% (58.7, 76.0) Complete response rate 12% Partial response rate 55% The median duration of response for the dose escalation cohort + Cohort A was 22.1 months (range: 1.0+ to 46.3+) and for Cohort K was not reached (range: 1.2 to 24.1+). Platinum-Ineligible Patients with Urothelial Carcinoma The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-052 (NCT02335424), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial in 370 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma who had one or more comorbidities, including patients who were not eligible for any platinum-containing chemotherapy. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of treatment during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Tumor response assessments were performed at 9 weeks after the first dose, then every 6 weeks for the first year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study population characteristics were: median age of 74 years; 77% male; and 89% White. Eighty-seven percent had M1 disease, and 13% had M0 disease. Eighty-one percent had a primary tumor in the lower tract, and 19% of patients had a primary tumor in the upper tract. Eighty-five percent of patients had visceral metastases, including 21% with liver metastases. Fifty percent of patients had baseline creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min, 32% had ECOG PS of 2, 9% had ECOG PS of 2 and baseline creatinine clearance of <60 mL/min, and 9% had one or more of Class III heart failure, Grade 2 or greater peripheral neuropathy, and Grade 2 or greater hearing loss. Ninety percent of patients were treatment naïve, and 10% received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. The median follow-up time for 370 patients treated with intravenous pembrolizumab was 11.4 months (range 0.1 to 63.8 months). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 75. Table 75: Efficacy Results in KEYNOTE-052 Endpoint Intravenous Pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks All Subjects n=370 + Denotes ongoing response Objective Response Rate ORR (95% CI) 29% (24, 34) Complete response rate 10% Partial response rate 20% Duration of Response Median in months (range) 33.4 (1.4+, 60.7+) Figure 16 Figure 17 Platinum-Eligible Patients with Previously Untreated Urothelial Carcinoma The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of platinum-eligible patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma was investigated in KEYNOTE-361 (NCT02853305), a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study in 1010 previously untreated patients. The safety and efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for previously untreated patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma has not been established. The study compared intravenous pembrolizumab with or without platinum-based chemotherapy (i.e., cisplatin or carboplatin with gemcitabine) to platinum-based chemotherapy alone. Among the patients receiving intravenous pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy, 44% received cisplatin and 56% received carboplatin. The study did not meet its major efficacy outcome measures of improved PFS or OS in the intravenous pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy arm compared to the chemotherapy-alone arm. Additional efficacy endpoints, including improvement of OS in the intravenous pembrolizumab monotherapy arm, could not be formally tested. Previously Treated Urothelial Carcinoma The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-045 (NCT02256436), a multicenter, randomized (1:1), active-controlled trial in 542 patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy. The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients were randomized to receive either intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (n=270) or investigator's choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens all given intravenously every 3 weeks (n=272): paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 (n=90), docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 (n=92), or vinflunine 320 mg/m 2 (n=90). Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of treatment during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed at 9 weeks after randomization, then every 6 weeks through the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcomes were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and DoR. The study population characteristics were: median age of 66 years (range: 26 to 88), 58% age 65 or older; 74% male; 72% White and 23% Asian; 42% ECOG PS of 0 and 56% ECOG PS of 1; and 96% M1 disease and 4% M0 disease. Eighty-seven percent of patients had visceral metastases, including 34% with liver metastases. Eighty-six percent had a primary tumor in the lower tract and 14% had a primary tumor in the upper tract. Fifteen percent of patients had disease progression following prior platinum-containing neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Twenty-one percent had received 2 or more prior systemic regimens in the metastatic setting. Seventy-six percent of patients received prior cisplatin, 23% had prior carboplatin, and 1% were treated with other platinum-based regimens. The study demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS and ORR for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab as compared to chemotherapy. There was no statistically significant difference between intravenous pembrolizumab and chemotherapy with respect to PFS. The median follow-up time for this trial was 9.0 months (range: 0.2 to 20.8 months). Table 76 and Figure 18 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-045.

The study excluded patients with primary non-bladder urothelial cancer (i.e., cancer of the ureter, urethral, or renal pelvis) and those with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Randomization was stratified by tumor stage (T2N0 vs T3/T4aN0 vs T1-T4aN1), cisplatin-eligibility (cisplatin-ineligible vs cisplatin-eligible but declined), and geographic region (United States vs European Union vs Rest of World). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive: Neoadjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg over 30 minutes as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 and enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for 3 cycles prior to surgery, followed by adjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg over 30 minutes on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for 14 cycles and adjuvant enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle for 6 cycles (n=170). Immediate RC and PLND alone (n=174). Treatment continued until completion of study medications, disease progression, not undergoing or refusal of RC and PLND, disease recurrence in the adjuvant phase, or unacceptable toxicity. Assessment of tumor status, including CT/MRI, was performed at baseline, within 5 weeks prior to RC and PLND, and at 6 weeks post-radical cystectomy. Following RC and PLND, assessment of tumor status, including cystoscopy and urine cytology for patients who did not undergo surgery, was performed every 12 weeks up to 2 years, and every 24 weeks thereafter. The study population characteristics were: median age of 73 years (range: 46 to 87 years); 78% male; 78% White, 16% Asian, 3.2% Multiple, 1.2% Black or African American, 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 1.2% missing; 6% Hispanic or Latino, 91% not Hispanic or Latino, and 2.9% not reported; 57% had ECOG PS of 0, 29% had ECOG PS of 1, and 14% had ECOG PS of 2; 18% were T2N0, 77% T3/T4aN0, and 4.9% T1T4aN1. Ninety-one percent of patients had pure urothelial carcinoma histology; 4.4% had urothelial carcinoma with squamous differentiation, 2.6% had urothelial carcinoma with glandular differentiation, and 2% had urothelial carcinoma with other variant histology. Among the 281 patients who were ineligible for cisplatin, 72% had baseline creatinine clearance of 30-59 mL/min, 17% had ECOG PS of 2, 21% had Grade 2 or greater hearing loss, 3.9% had New York Heart Association Class III heart failure, and 13% met more than one cisplatin-ineligibility criterion. A total of 149 (88%) patients in the intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin arm and 156 (90%) patients in the RC and PLND alone arm underwent RC and PLND. The trial was not designed to isolate the effect of intravenous pembrolizumab in each phase (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) of treatment. The major efficacy outcome measure was EFS as assessed by BICR. Overall survival (OS) and pathological complete response (pCR) rate as assessed by blinded independent pathology review were additional efficacy outcome measures. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in EFS and OS in patients treated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with enfortumab vedotin compared with RC and PLND alone. Table 77 and Figures 19 and 20 summarize key efficacy measures.

Figure 18 Figure 19 Figure 20 BCG-unresponsive High-Risk Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-057 (NCT02625961), a multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial in 96 patients with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-unresponsive, high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) with carcinoma in situ (CIS) with or without papillary tumors who are ineligible for or have elected not to undergo cystectomy. BCG-unresponsive high-risk NMIBC was defined as persistent disease despite adequate BCG therapy, disease recurrence after an initial tumor-free state following adequate BCG therapy, or T1 disease following a single induction course of BCG. Adequate BCG therapy was defined as administration of at least five of six doses of an initial induction course plus either of: at least two of three doses of maintenance therapy or at least two of six doses of a second induction course. Prior to treatment, all patients had undergone transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) to remove all resectable disease (Ta and T1 components). Residual CIS (Tis components) not amenable to complete resection was allowed. The trial excluded patients with muscle invasive (i.e., T2, T3, T4) locally advanced non-resectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, concurrent extra-vesical (i.e., urethra, ureter or renal pelvis) non-muscle invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelium, or autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity, persistent or recurrent high-risk NMIBC, or progressive disease. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 12 weeks for two years and then every 24 weeks for three years, and patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. The major efficacy outcome measures were complete response (as defined by negative results for cystoscopy [with TURBT/biopsies as applicable], urine cytology, and computed tomography urography [CTU] imaging) and duration of response. The study population characteristics were: median age of 73 years (range: 44 to 92); 44% age ≥75; 84% male; 67% White; and 73% and 27% with an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, respectively. Tumor pattern at study entry was CIS with T1 (13%), CIS with high grade TA (25%), and CIS (63%). Baseline high-risk NMIBC disease status was 27% persistent and 73% recurrent. The median number of prior instillations of BCG was 12. The median follow-up time was 28.0 months (range: 4.6 to 40.5 months). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 78.

All trials excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Regardless of histology, MSI or MMR tumor status was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR; local or central) or immunohistochemistry (IHC; local or central), respectively. KEYNOTE-164 enrolled 124 patients with advanced MSI-H or dMMR colorectal cancer (CRC) that progressed following treatment with fluoropyrimidine and either oxaliplatin or irinotecan +/- anti-VEGF/EGFR mAb-based therapy. KEYNOTE-158 enrolled 373 patients with advanced MSI-H or dMMR non-colorectal cancers (non-CRC) who had disease progression following prior therapy. Patients were either prospectively enrolled with MSI-H/dMMR tumors (Cohort K) or retrospectively identified in one of 10 solid tumor cohorts (Cohorts A-J). KEYNOTE-051 enrolled 7 pediatric patients with MSI-H or dMMR cancers. Adult patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (pediatric patients received 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks) until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or a maximum of 24 months. In KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158, assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks through the first year, then every 12 weeks thereafter. In KEYNOTE-051, assessment of tumor status was performed every 8 weeks for 24 weeks, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ in KEYNOTE-158) and as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 in KEYNOTE-051. In KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-158, the study population characteristics were median age of 60 years, 36% age 65 or older; 44% male; 78% White, 14% Asian, 4% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 3% Black; and 45% ECOG PS of 0 and 55% ECOG PS of 1. Ninety-two percent of patients had metastatic disease and 4% had locally advanced, unresectable disease. Thirty-seven percent of patients received one prior line of therapy and 61% received two or more prior lines of therapy. In KEYNOTE-051, the study population characteristics were median age of 11 years (range: 3 to 16); 71% female; 86% White and 14% Asian; and 57% had a Lansky/Karnofsky Score of 100. Seventy-one percent of patients had Stage IV and 14% had Stage III disease. Fifty-seven percent of patients received one prior line of therapy and 29% received two prior lines of therapy. Discordant results were observed between local MSI-H or dMMR tests and central testing among patients enrolled in Cohort K of KEYNOTE-158. Among 104 tumor samples that were MSI-H or dMMR by local testing and also tested using the FoundationOne ® CDx (F1CDx) test, 59 (56.7%) were MSI-H and 45 (43.3%) were not MSI-H. Among 169 tumor samples that were MSI-H or dMMR by local testing and also tested using the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel, 105 (62.1%) were dMMR and 64 (37.9%) were pMMR. Efficacy results are summarized in Tables 79 and 80.

Among the 45 patients with TMB score of <10 mut/Mb, 39 of the patients were pMMR/not MSI-H when tested using an FDA-approved test. 14.8 Microsatellite Instability-High or Mismatch Repair Deficient Colorectal Cancer The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-177 (NCT02563002), a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial that enrolled 307 patients with previously untreated unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR CRC. MSI or MMR tumor status was determined locally using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or investigator’s choice of the following chemotherapy regimens given intravenously every 2 weeks: mFOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and FU) or mFOLFOX6 in combination with either bevacizumab or cetuximab: Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m 2 , leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 (or levoleucovorin 200 mg/m 2 ), and FU 400 mg/m 2 bolus on Day 1, then FU 2400 mg/m 2 over 46-48 hours. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg on Day 1 or cetuximab 400 mg/m 2 on first infusion, then 250 mg/m 2 weekly. FOLFIRI (irinotecan, leucovorin, and FU) or FOLFIRI in combination with either bevacizumab or cetuximab: Irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 , leucovorin 400 mg/m 2 (or levoleucovorin 200 mg/m 2 ), and FU 400 mg/m 2 bolus on Day 1, then FU 2400 mg/m 2 over 46-48 hours. Bevacizumab 5 mg/kg on Day 1 or cetuximab 400 mg/m 2 on first infusion, then 250 mg/m 2 weekly. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab or chemotherapy continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by the investigator or unacceptable toxicity. Patients treated with intravenous pembrolizumab without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. Patients randomized to chemotherapy were offered intravenous pembrolizumab at the time of disease progression. The main efficacy outcome measures were PFS (as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ) and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR. A total of 307 patients were enrolled and randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab (n=153) or chemotherapy (n=154). The baseline characteristics of these 307 patients were: median age of 63 years (range: 24 to 93), 47% age 65 or older; 50% male; 75% White and 16% Asian; 52% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 48% had an ECOG PS of 1; and 27% received prior adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among 154 patients randomized to receive chemotherapy,143 received chemotherapy per the protocol. Of the 143 patients, 56% received mFOLFOX6, 44% received FOLFIRI, 70% received bevacizumab plus mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI, and 11% received cetuximab plus mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in PFS for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy. There was no statistically significant difference between intravenous pembrolizumab and chemotherapy in the final OS analysis. Sixty percent of the patients who had been randomized to receive chemotherapy had crossed over to receive subsequent anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies including intravenous pembrolizumab. The median follow-up time at the final analysis was 38.1 months (range: 0.2 to 58.7 months). Table 81 and Figure 21 summarize the key efficacy measures for KEYNOTE-177.

PD-L1 status was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx ™ kit. Patients with an autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1 or CPS <1), chemotherapy regimen (5-FU plus cisplatin [FP] or capecitabine plus oxaliplatin [CAPOX]), and geographic region (Europe/Israel/North America/Australia, Asia, or Rest of the World). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg, trastuzumab 8 mg/kg on first infusion and 6 mg/kg in subsequent cycles, followed by investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy of cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 for up to 6 cycles and 5-FU 800 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (FP) or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 up to 6-8 cycles and capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 bid for 14 days (CAPOX). Placebo, trastuzumab 8 mg/kg on first infusion and 6 mg/kg in subsequent cycles, followed by investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy of cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 for up to 6 cycles and 5-FU 800 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (FP) or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 up to 6-8 cycles and capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 bid for 14 days (CAPOX). All study medications, except oral capecitabine, were administered as an intravenous infusion every 3-week cycle. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. The major outcome measures assessed were PFS by BICR using RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, and OS. Additional outcome measures included ORR and DoR, based on BICR using RECIST 1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Among the 698 patients randomized, 594 (85%) had tumors that expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥1. PD-L1 status was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx™ kit. The population characteristics of these 594 patients were: median age of 63 years (range: 19 to 85), 43% age 65 or older; 80% male; 63% White, 33% Asian, and 0.7% Black; 42% ECOG PS of 0 and 58% ECOG PS of 1. Ninety-eight percent of patients had metastatic disease (Stage IV) and 2% had locally advanced unresectable disease. Ninety-five percent (n=562) had tumors that were not MSI-H, 1% (n=8) had tumors that were MSI-H, and in 4% (n=24) the status was not known. Eighty-five percent of patients received CAPOX. A statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS was demonstrated in patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy compared with placebo in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy; however, an exploratory analysis of OS in the PD-L1 CPS <1 population showed a HR of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.68), indicating that the improvement in the ITT population was primarily attributed to the results observed in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1. Efficacy results at the final analysis for the subgroup of patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥1 are summarized in Table 82 and Figure 22.

Patients with an autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1 or CPS <1), chemotherapy regimen (FP or CAPOX), and geographic region (Europe/Israel/North America/Australia, Asia, or Rest of the World). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg, investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy of cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 and 5-FU 800 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (FP) or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 and capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 bid for 14 days (CAPOX). Placebo, investigator’s choice of combination chemotherapy of cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 and 5-FU 800 mg/m 2 /day for 5 days (FP) or oxaliplatin 130 mg/m 2 and capecitabine 1000 mg/m 2 bid for 14 days (CAPOX). All study medications, except oral capecitabine, were administered as an intravenous infusion every 3-week cycle. Platinum agents could be administered for 6 or more cycles following local guidelines. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. The major efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional secondary efficacy outcome measures included PFS, ORR, and DoR as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Among 1,579 patients, 1,235 (78%) had tumors expressing PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1. The population characteristics in patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 expressing tumors were: median age of 62 years (range: 24 to 86), 40% age 65 or older; 70% male and 30% female; 55% White, 33% Asian, 4.6% Multiple, 4.3% American Indian or Alaskan Native, 1.3% Black, and 0.2% Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; 76% Not Hispanic or Latino and 21% Hispanic or Latino; 37% ECOG PS of 0 and 63% ECOG PS of 1. Ninety-six percent of patients had metastatic disease (Stage IV) and 3% had locally advanced unresectable disease. Five percent (n=66) had tumors that were MSI-H. Eighty-six percent of patients received CAPOX. A statistically significant improvement in OS, PFS, and ORR was demonstrated in patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with placebo in combination with chemotherapy at the time of a pre-specified interim analysis of OS; however, an exploratory analysis of OS in the PD-L1 CPS <1 population showed a HR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.73, 1.17) indicating that the improvement in the ITT population was primarily attributed to the results observed in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1. Efficacy results for patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥10 are summarized in Table 83 and Figures 23 and 24.

PD-L1 status was centrally determined in tumor specimens in all patients using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. Patients with active autoimmune disease, a medical condition that required immunosuppression, or who received prior systemic therapy in the locally advanced or metastatic setting were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by tumor histology (squamous cell carcinoma vs. adenocarcinoma), geographic region (Asia vs. ex-Asia), and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms; all study medications were administered via intravenous infusion: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 of each three-week cycle in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to six cycles and FU 800 mg/m 2 IV per day on Day 1 to Day 5 of each three-week cycle, or per local standard for FU administration, for up to 24 months. Placebo on Day 1 of each three-week cycle in combination with cisplatin 80 mg/m 2 IV on Day 1 of each three-week cycle for up to six cycles and FU 800 mg/m 2 IV per day on Day 1 to Day 5 of each three-week cycle, or per local standard for FU administration, for up to 24 months. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab or chemotherapy continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients could be treated with intravenous pembrolizumab for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression. The major efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ). The study pre-specified analyses of OS and PFS based on squamous cell histology, CPS ≥10, and in all patients. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR, according to modified RECIST v1.1, as assessed by the investigator. Additional analyses of efficacy outcome measures were also conducted based on PD-L1 CPS ≥1. Among 749 patients, 647 (86%) had tumors expressing PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1. The study population characteristics in patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 expressing tumors were: median age of 63 years (range: 27 to 89), 41% age 65 or older; 83% male; 36% White, 54% Asian, and 1% Black; 40% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 59% had an ECOG PS of 1. Ninety-one percent had M1 disease and 9% had M0 disease. Seventy-four percent had a tumor histology of squamous cell carcinoma, and 26% had adenocarcinoma. The trial demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy; however, an exploratory analysis of OS in the PD-L1 CPS <1 population showed an HR of 0.96 (0.59, 1.55), indicating that the improvement in the ITT population was primarily attributed to the results observed in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1. Table 84 and Figures 25 and 26 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-590 in patients whose tumors expressed PD-L1 CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥10.

In an exploratory analysis, in patients with PD-L1 CPS <10 (n=347), the median OS was 10.5 months (95% CI: 9.7, 13.5) for the intravenous pembrolizumab arm and 10.6 months (95% CI: 8.8, 12.0) for the placebo arm, with a HR of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.68, 1.10). Previously Treated Recurrent Locally Advanced or Metastatic Esophageal Cancer for Tumors Expressing PD-L1 (CPS≥ 10) KEYNOTE-181 The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-181 (NCT02564263), a multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial that enrolled 628 patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic esophageal cancer who progressed on or after one prior line of systemic treatment for advanced disease. Patients with HER2/neu positive esophageal cancer were required to have received treatment with approved HER2/neu targeted therapy. All patients were required to have tumor specimens for PD-L1 testing at a central laboratory; PD-L1 status was determined using the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. Patients with a history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required steroids or current pneumonitis, active autoimmune disease, or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks or investigator's choice of any of the following chemotherapy regimens, all given intravenously: paclitaxel 80-100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 4-week cycle, docetaxel 75 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks, or irinotecan 180 mg/m 2 every 2 weeks. Randomization was stratified by tumor histology (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [ESCC] vs. esophageal adenocarcinoma [EAC]/Siewert type I EAC of the gastroesophageal junction [GEJ]), and geographic region (Asia vs. ex-Asia). Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab or chemotherapy continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab were permitted to continue beyond the first RECIST v1.1 (modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ)-defined disease progression if clinically stable until the first radiographic evidence of disease progression was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients treated with intravenous pembrolizumab without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measure was OS evaluated in the following co-primary populations: patients with ESCC, patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 CPS ≥10, and all randomized patients. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS, ORR, and DoR, according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR. A total of 628 patients were enrolled and randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab (n=314) or investigator's treatment of choice (n=314). Of these 628 patients, 167 (27%) had ESCC that expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥10. Of these 167 patients, 85 patients were randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab and 82 patients to investigator's treatment of choice [paclitaxel (n=50), docetaxel (n=19), or irinotecan (n=13)]. The baseline characteristics of these 167 patients were: median age of 65 years (range: 33 to 80), 51% age 65 or older; 84% male; 32% White and 68% Asian; 38% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 62% had an ECOG PS of 1. Ninety percent had M1 disease and 10% had M0 disease. Prior to enrollment, 99% of patients had received platinum-based treatment and 84% had also received treatment with a fluoropyrimidine. Thirty-three percent of patients received prior treatment with a taxane. The observed OS hazard ratio was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.96) in patients with ESCC, 0.70 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.94) in patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 CPS ≥10, and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.75, 1.05) in all randomized patients. On further examination in patients whose ESCC tumors expressed PD-L1 (CPS ≥10), an improvement in OS was observed among patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab as compared with chemotherapy. Table 85 and Figure 27 summarize the key efficacy measures for KEYNOTE-181 for patients with ESCC CPS ≥10.

With the exception of the number of prior lines of treatment, the eligibility criteria were similar to and the dosage regimen identical to KEYNOTE-181. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR. Among the 121 patients enrolled, 29% (n=35) had ESCC that expressed PD-L1 CPS ≥10. The baseline characteristics of these 35 patients were: median age of 65 years (range: 47 to 81), 51% age 65 or older; 71% male; 26% White and 69% Asian; 40% had an ECOG PS of 0 and 60% had an ECOG PS of 1. One hundred percent had M1 disease. The ORR in the 35 patients with ESCC expressing PD-L1 was 20% (95% CI: 8, 37). Among the 7 responding patients, the DoR ranged from 4.2 to 25.1+ months, with 5 patients (71%) having responses of 6 months or longer and 3 patients (57%) having responses of 12 months or longer. 14.11 Cervical Cancer FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA Cervical Cancer with Chemoradiotherapy The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with CRT (cisplatin and external beam radiation therapy [EBRT] followed by brachytherapy [BT]) was investigated in KEYNOTE-A18 (NCT04221945), a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that enrolled 1060 patients with cervical cancer who had not previously received any definitive surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy for cervical cancer. There were 599 patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA disease (tumor involves the lower third of the vagina or the pelvic sidewall, or there is hydronephrosis/non-functioning kidney or spread to adjacent pelvic organs, all without spread to distant organs), and 459 patients with FIGO 2014 Stage IB2-IIB disease (clinical lesion >4 cm confined to the cervix, or clinical lesion of any size with extension beyond the uterus, but which has not extended to the pelvic wall or lower third of the vagina) with positive nodes. Two patients had FIGO 2014 Stage IVB disease. Randomization was stratified by planned type of EBRT (Intensity-modulated radiation therapy [IMRT] or volumetric modulated arc therapy [VMAT] vs. non-IMRT and non-VMAT), stage at screening of cervical cancer (FIGO 2014 Stage IB2-IIB vs. FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA), and planned total radiotherapy dose (EBRT + brachytherapy dose of <70 Gy vs. ≥70 Gy as per equivalent dose [EQD2]). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of two treatment arms: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg IV every 3 weeks (5 cycles) concurrent with cisplatin 40 mg/m 2 IV weekly (5 cycles, an optional sixth infusion could be administered per local practice), and radiotherapy (EBRT followed by BT), followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 400 mg IV every 6 weeks (15 cycles) Placebo IV every 3 weeks (5 cycles) concurrent with cisplatin 40 mg/m 2 IV weekly (5 cycles, an optional sixth infusion could be administered per local practice), and radiotherapy (EBRT followed by BT), followed by placebo IV every 6 weeks (15 cycles) Treatment continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by investigator or unacceptable toxicity. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 12 weeks from completion of CRT for the first two years, followed by every 24 weeks in year 3, and then annually. The major efficacy outcome measures were PFS as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, or histopathologic confirmation, and OS. Among the 599 patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA disease, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 52 years (range: 22 to 87), 17% age 65 or older; 36% White, 34% Asian, 2% Black; 38% Hispanic or Latino; 68% ECOG PS 0 and 32% ECOG PS 1; 93% with CPS ≥1; 71% had positive pelvic and/or positive para-aortic lymph node(s) and 29% had neither positive pelvic nor para-aortic lymph node(s); 83% had squamous cell carcinoma and 17% had non-squamous histology. Regarding radiation, 86% of patients received IMRT or VMAT EBRT, and the median EQD2 dose was 87 Gy (range: 7 to 114). The trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and OS in the ITT population. Exploratory analyses of PFS and OS by the stratification factor of FIGO 2014 stage showed that the improvement in the ITT population was primarily attributed to the results seen in the patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA disease. Table 86 and Figures 28 and 29 summarize the results in exploratory subgroup analyses of 599 patients with FIGO 2014 Stage III-IVA disease.

Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression status. Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by metastatic status at initial diagnosis, investigator decision to use bevacizumab, and PD-L1 status (CPS <1 vs. CPS 1 to <10 vs. CPS ≥10). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the two treatment groups: Treatment Group 1: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg plus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab Treatment Group 2: Placebo plus chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab The investigator selected one of the following four treatment regimens prior to randomization: Paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 + cisplatin 50 mg/m 2 Paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 + cisplatin 50 mg/m 2 + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg Paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 + carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min Paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 + carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min + bevacizumab 15 mg/kg All study medications were administered as an intravenous infusion. All study treatments were administered on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle. Cisplatin could be administered on Day 2 of each 3-week treatment cycle. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Administration of intravenous pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first year, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by investigator according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR, according to RECIST v1.1, as assessed by investigator. Of the 617 enrolled patients, 548 patients (89%) had tumors expressing PD-L1 with a CPS ≥1. Among these 548 enrolled patients with tumors expressing PD-L1, 273 patients were randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab, and 275 patients were randomized to placebo in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab. Sixty-three percent of the 548 patients received bevacizumab as part of study treatment. The baseline characteristics of the 548 patients were: median age of 51 years (range: 22 to 82), 16% age 65 or older; 59% White, 18% Asian, 6% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 1% Black; 37% Hispanic or Latino; 56% ECOG performance status 0 and 43% ECOG performance status 1. Seventy-five percent had squamous cell carcinoma, 21% adenocarcinoma, and 5% adenosquamous histology, and 32% of patients had metastatic disease at diagnosis. At study entry, 21% of patients had metastatic disease only and 79% had persistent or recurrent disease with or without distant metastases, of whom 39% had received prior chemoradiation only and 17% had received prior chemoradiation plus surgery. A statistically significant improvement in OS and PFS was demonstrated in patients randomized to receive intravenous pembrolizumab compared with patients randomized to receive placebo. An updated OS analysis was conducted at the time of final analysis when 354 deaths in the CPS ≥1 population were observed. Table 87 and Figure 30 summarize the key efficacy measures for KEYNOTE-826 for patients with tumors expressing PD-L1 (CPS ≥1).

The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of treatment during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, was rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Patients without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 12 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, as assessed by BICR, and DoR. Among the 98 patients in Cohort E, 77 (79%) had tumors that expressed PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 and received at least one line of chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. PD-L1 status was determined using the IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit. The baseline characteristics of these 77 patients were: median age of 45 years (range: 27 to 75); 81% White, 14% Asian, and 3% Black; 32% ECOG PS of 0 and 68% ECOG PS of 1; 92% had squamous cell carcinoma, 6% adenocarcinoma, and 1% adenosquamous histology; 95% had M1 disease and 5% had recurrent disease; and 35% had one and 65% had two or more prior lines of therapy in the recurrent or metastatic setting. No responses were observed in patients whose tumors did not have PD-L1 expression (CPS <1). Efficacy results are summarized in Table 88 for patients with PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1).

Patients were also required to have Child-Pugh A liver function. Patients with hepatitis B had treated controlled disease (HBV viral load <2000 IU/mL or <10 4 copies/mL). Patients with an autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients with hepatic encephalopathy, main branch portal venous invasion, clinically apparent ascites, or esophageal or gastric variceal bleeding within the last 6 months were also ineligible. Randomization was stratified by prior treatment: sorafenib vs. oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, macrovascular invasion, and etiology (active HBV vs. others (active HCV, non-infected)). Patients were randomized (2:1) to receive pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks or placebo. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as determined by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 6 weeks. The main efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS, ORR, and DoR, as assessed by BICR using RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The study enrolled 453 patients, and 360 (79%) had active hepatitis B. The population characteristics in patients with active hepatitis B were: median age of 52 years (range: 23 to 82), 16% age 65 or older; 86% male; 100% Asian; 42% ECOG PS of 0 and 58% ECOG PS of 1; 90% received prior sorafenib and 10% received prior oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Patient characteristics also included extrahepatic disease (77%), macrovascular invasion (10%), BCLC stage C (93%) and B (7%), and baseline AFP ≥200 ng/mL (57%). KEYNOTE-394 demonstrated improved OS in patients with HCC secondary to hepatitis B randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab compared with placebo. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 89 and Figure 31.

Patients with autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by region (Asia vs. non-Asia), locally advanced versus metastatic, and site of origin (gallbladder, intrahepatic or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). Patients were randomized (1:1) to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and Day 8 every 3 weeks, or placebo on Day 1 plus gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 and cisplatin 25 mg/m 2 on Day 1 and Day 8 every 3 weeks. Study medications were administered via intravenous infusion. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. For pembrolizumab, treatment continued for a maximum of 35 cycles, or approximately 24 months. For gemcitabine, treatment could be continued beyond 8 cycles while for cisplatin, treatment could be administered for a maximum of 8 cycles. Administration of intravenous pembrolizumab with chemotherapy was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline and then every 6 weeks through 54 weeks, followed by every 12 weeks thereafter. Study population characteristics were median age of 64 years (range: 23 to 85), 47% age 65 or older; 52% male; 49% White, 46% Asian, 1.3% Black or African American; 10% Hispanic or Latino; 46% ECOG PS of 0 and 54% ECOG PS of 1; 31% of patients had a history of hepatitis B infection, and 3% had a history of hepatitis C infection. The major efficacy outcome measure was OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures were PFS, ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.

Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg (KEYNOTE-017) or 200 mg (KEYNOTE-913) every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression that was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, occurred with a decline in performance status, or was confirmed at least 4 weeks later with repeat imaging. Patients without disease progression were treated for up to 24 months. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR per RECIST v1.1. Among the 105 patients enrolled, the median age was 73 years (range: 38 to 91), 79% were age 65 or older; 62% were male; 80% were White, race in 19% was unknown or missing, and 1% were Asian; 53% had ECOG PS of 0, and 47% had ECOG PS of 1. Thirteen percent had stage IIIB disease and 84% had stage IV. Seventy-six percent of patients had prior surgery and 51% had prior radiation therapy. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 91.

Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression within the last 2 years were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk categories (favorable versus intermediate versus poor) and geographic region (North America versus Western Europe versus “Rest of the World”). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks up to 24 months in combination with axitinib 5 mg orally, twice daily. Patients who tolerated axitinib 5 mg twice daily for 2 consecutive cycles (6 weeks) could increase to 7 mg and then subsequently to 10 mg twice daily. Axitinib could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity. Sunitinib 50 mg orally, once daily for 4 weeks and then off treatment for 2 weeks. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab and axitinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of intravenous pembrolizumab and axitinib was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline, after randomization at Week 12, then every 6 weeks thereafter until Week 54, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 26 to 90), 38% age 65 or older; 73% male; 79% White and 16% Asian; 20% and 80% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively; and patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 31% favorable, 56% intermediate, and 13% poor. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR, as assessed by BICR. A statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated at the first pre-specified interim analysis in patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with axitinib compared with sunitinib. The trial also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and ORR. An updated OS analysis was conducted when 418 deaths were observed based on the planned number of deaths for the pre-specified final analysis.

First-line treatment with lenvatinib KEYNOTE-581 The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib was investigated in KEYNOTE-581 (NCT02811861), a multicenter, open-label, randomized trial conducted in 1069 patients with advanced RCC in the first-line setting. Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by geographic region (North America versus Western Europe versus “Rest of the World”) and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) prognostic groups (favorable versus intermediate versus poor risk). Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks up to 24 months in combination with lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily. Lenvatinib 18 mg orally once daily in combination with everolimus 5 mg orally once daily. Sunitinib 50 mg orally once daily for 4 weeks then off treatment for 2 weeks. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Administration of intravenous pembrolizumab with lenvatinib was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. intravenous pembrolizumab was continued for a maximum of 24 months; however, treatment with lenvatinib could be continued beyond 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline and then every 8 weeks. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 29 to 88 years), 42% age 65 or older; 75% male; 74% White, 21% Asian, 1% Black, and 2% other races; 18% and 82% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively; patient distribution by MSKCC risk categories was 27% favorable, 64% intermediate, and 9% poor. Common sites of metastases in patients were lung (68%), lymph node (45%), and bone (25%). The major efficacy outcome measures were PFS, as assessed by independent radiologic review (IRC) according to RECIST v1.1, and OS. Additional efficacy outcome measures included confirmed ORR as assessed by IRC. intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS, OS, and ORR compared with sunitinib. An updated OS analysis was conducted when 304 deaths were observed based on the planned number of deaths for the pre-specified final analysis.

Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 400 mg every 6 weeks in combination with lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily. Intravenous pembrolizumab was continued for a maximum of 24 months; however, lenvatinib could be continued beyond 24 months. Treatment continued until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Administration of intravenous pembrolizumab with lenvatinib was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was considered by the investigator to be deriving clinical benefit. Among the 158 treated patients, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 60 years (range: 24 to 87 years); 71% male; 86% White, 8% Asian, and 3% Black; <1% Hispanic or Latino; 22% and 78% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively; histologic subtypes were 59% papillary, 18% chromophobe, 4% translocation, <1% medullary, 13% unclassified, and 6% other; patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 35% favorable, 54% intermediate, and 10% poor. Common sites of metastases in patients were lymph node (65%), lung (35%), bone (30%), and liver (21%). The major efficacy outcome measure was ORR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Additional efficacy outcome measures included DOR as assessed by BICR using RECIST 1.1. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 94.

The intermediate-high risk category included: pT2 with Grade 4 or sarcomatoid features; pT3, any Grade without nodal involvement (N0) or distant metastases (M0). The high risk category included: pT4, any Grade N0 and M0; any pT, any Grade with nodal involvement and M0. The M1 NED category included patients with metastatic disease who had undergone complete resection of primary and metastatic lesions. Patients must have undergone a partial nephroprotective or radical complete nephrectomy (and complete resection of solid, isolated, soft tissue metastatic lesion(s) in M1 NED participants) with negative surgical margins ≥4 weeks prior to the time of screening. Patients were excluded from the trial if they had received prior systemic therapy for advanced RCC. Patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were also ineligible. Patients were randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg administered intravenously every 3 weeks or placebo for up to 1 year until disease recurrence or unacceptable toxicity. Randomization was stratified by metastasis status (M0, M1 NED); M0 group was further stratified by ECOG PS (0,1) and geographic region (US, non-US). The study population characteristics were: median age of 60 years (range: 25 to 84), 33% age 65 or older; 71% male; 75% White, 14% Asian, 9% Unknown, 1% Black or African American, 1% American Indian or Alaska Native, 1% Multiracial; 13% Hispanic or Latino, 78% Not Hispanic or Latino, 8% Unknown; and 85% ECOG PS of 0 and 15% ECOG PS of 1. Ninety-four percent of patients enrolled had N0 disease; 11% had sarcomatoid features; 86% were intermediate-high risk; 8% were high risk; and 6% were M1 NED. Ninety-two percent of patients had a radical nephrectomy, and 8% had a partial nephrectomy. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS), defined as time to recurrence, metastasis, or death. An additional outcome measure was OS. Statistically significant improvements in DFS and OS were demonstrated at pre-specified interim analyses in patients randomized to the intravenous pembrolizumab arm compared with placebo. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 95 and Figures 36 and 37.

The study design included two separate cohorts based on MMR status; 222 (27%) patients were in dMMR cohort, 588 (73%) patients were in pMMR cohort. The trial enrolled measurable Stage III, measurable Stage IVA, Stage IVB or recurrent endometrial cancer (with or without measurable disease). Patients who had not received prior systemic therapy or had received prior chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting were eligible. Patients who had received prior adjuvant chemotherapy were only eligible if their chemotherapy-free interval was at least 12 months. Patients with endometrial sarcoma, including carcinosarcoma, or patients with active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified according to MMR status, ECOG PS (0 or 1 vs. 2), and prior adjuvant chemotherapy. Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks, paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min for 6 cycles, followed by intravenous pembrolizumab 400 mg every 6 weeks for up to 14 cycles. Placebo every 3 weeks, paclitaxel 175 mg/m 2 and carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min for 6 cycles, followed by placebo every 6 weeks for up to 14 cycles. All study medications were administered as an intravenous infusion on Day 1 of each treatment cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 20 cycles (up to approximately 24 months). Patients with measurable disease who had RECIST-defined stable disease or partial response at the completion of cycle 6 were permitted to continue receiving paclitaxel and carboplatin with intravenous pembrolizumab or placebo for up to 10 cycles as determined by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 9 months and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measure was PFS as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST 1.1. An additional efficacy outcome measure was OS. The dMMR population characteristics were: median age of 66 years (range: 37 to 86), 55% age 65 or older; 79% White, 9% Black, and 3% Asian; 5% Hispanic or Latino; 64% ECOG PS of 0, 33% ECOG PS of 1, and 3% ECOG PS of 2; 61% had recurrent disease and 39% had primary or persistent disease; 5% received prior adjuvant chemotherapy and 43% received prior radiotherapy. The histologic subtypes were endometrioid carcinoma (81%), adenocarcinoma NOS (11%), serous carcinoma (2%), and other (6%). The pMMR population characteristics were: median age of 66 years (range: 29 to 94), 54% age 65 or older; 72% White, 16% Black, and 5% Asian; 6% Hispanic or Latino; 67% ECOG PS of 0, 30% ECOG PS of 1, and 3% ECOG PS of 2; 56% had recurrent disease and 44% had primary or persistent disease; 26% received prior adjuvant chemotherapy and 41% received prior radiotherapy. The histologic subtypes were endometrioid carcinoma (52%), serous carcinoma (26%), adenocarcinoma NOS (10%), clear cell carcinoma (7%), and other (5%). The trial demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin compared to placebo in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in both the dMMR and pMMR populations. Table 96 and Figures 38 and 39 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-868 by MMR status. At the time of the PFS analysis, OS data were not mature with 12% deaths in the dMMR population and 17% deaths in the pMMR population.

High-risk disease was defined as any of the following (staging per FIGO 2009): Stage I/II with myometrial invasion and either non-endometrioid histology or aberrant p53 expression or p53 mutation, or Stage III/IVA. The trial did not meet the prespecified primary endpoint for investigator-assessed DFS, with a HR of 1.02 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.32). In Combination with Lenvatinib for the Treatment of Advanced Endometrial Carcinoma That Is pMMR or Not MSI-H The efficacy of intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib was investigated in KEYNOTE-775 (NCT03517449), a multicenter, open-label, randomized, active-controlled trial that enrolled 827 patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma who had been previously treated with at least one prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen in any setting, including in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings. Patients with endometrial sarcoma, including carcinosarcoma, or patients who had active autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients with endometrial carcinoma that were pMMR (using the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel test) or not MSI-H were stratified by ECOG performance status, geographic region, and history of pelvic radiation. Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks in combination with lenvatinib 20 mg orally once daily. Investigator’s choice, consisting of either doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks or paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 given weekly, 3 weeks on/1 week off. Treatment with intravenous pembrolizumab and lenvatinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease as verified by BICR, unacceptable toxicity, or for intravenous pembrolizumab, a maximum of 24 months. Treatment was permitted beyond RECIST v1.1-defined disease progression if the treating investigator considered the patient to be deriving clinical benefit, and the treatment was tolerated. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 8 weeks. The major efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR and DoR, as assessed by BICR. Among the 697 pMMR patients, 346 patients were randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib, and 351 patients were randomized to investigator’s choice of doxorubicin (n=254) or paclitaxel (n=97). The pMMR population characteristics were: median age of 65 years (range: 30 to 86), 52% age 65 or older; 62% White, 22% Asian, and 3% Black; 60% ECOG PS of 0 and 40% ECOG PS of 1. The histologic subtypes were endometrioid carcinoma (55%), serous (30%), clear cell carcinoma (7%), mixed (4%), and other (3%). All 697 of these patients received prior systemic therapy for endometrial carcinoma: 67% had one, 30% had two, and 3% had three or more prior systemic therapies. Thirty-seven percent of patients received only prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy. Efficacy results for the pMMR or not MSI-H patients are summarized in Table 97 and Figures 40 and 41.

The trial enrolled 90 patients with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR endometrial carcinoma in Cohorts D and K. MSI or MMR tumor status was determined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Patients treated with intravenous pembrolizumab without disease progression could be treated for up to 24 months. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 12 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Among the 90 patients evaluated, the baseline characteristics were: median age of 64 years (range: 42 to 86); 83% White, 8% Asian, and 3% Black; 12% Hispanic or Latino; 39% ECOG PS of 0 and 61% ECOG PS of 1; 96% had M1 disease and 4% had M0 disease at study entry; and 51% had one and 48% had two or more prior lines of therapy. Nine patients received only adjuvant therapy and one patient received only neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy before participating in the study. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 98.

The trial excluded patients who previously received an anti-PD-1 or other immune-modulating monoclonal antibody, or who had an autoimmune disease, or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease progression. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 9 weeks for the first 12 months and every 12 weeks thereafter. The statistical analysis plan pre-specified ≥10 and ≥13 mutations per megabase using the FoundationOne CDx assay as cutpoints to assess TMB. Testing of TMB was blinded with respect to clinical outcomes. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR in patients who received at least one dose of intravenous pembrolizumab as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. In KEYNOTE-158, 1050 patients were included in the efficacy analysis population. TMB was analyzed in the subset of 790 patients with sufficient tissue for testing based on protocol-specified testing requirements. Of the 790 patients, 102 (13%) had tumors identified as TMB-H, defined as TMB ≥10 mutations per megabase. Among the 102 patients with TMB-H advanced solid tumors, the study population characteristics were: median age of 61 years (range: 27 to 80), 34% age 65 or older; 34% male; 81% White; and 41% ECOG PS of 0 and 58% ECOG PS of 1. Fifty-six percent of patients had at least two prior lines of therapy. Efficacy results are summarized in Tables 99 and 100.

The trial excluded patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required immunosuppression. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 24 months. Patients with initial radiographic disease progression could receive additional doses of intravenous pembrolizumab during confirmation of progression unless disease progression was symptomatic, rapidly progressive, required urgent intervention, or occurred with a decline in performance status. Assessment of tumor status was performed every 6 weeks during the first year, and every 9 weeks during the second year. The major efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Among the 105 patients with recurrent or metastatic cSCC treated, the study population characteristics were: median age of 72 years (range: 29 to 95), 71% age 65 or older; 76% male; 70% White, 25% race unknown; 34% ECOG PS of 0 and 66% ECOG PS of 1. Forty-five percent of patients had locally recurrent only cSCC, 24% had metastatic only cSCC, and 31% had both locally recurrent and metastatic cSCC. Eighty-seven percent received one or more prior lines of therapy; 73% received prior radiation therapy. Among the 54 patients with locally advanced cSCC treated, the study population characteristics were: median age of 76 years (range: 35 to 95), 80% age 65 or older; 72% male; 83% White, 13% race unknown; 41% ECOG PS of 0 and 59% ECOG PS of 1. Twenty-two percent received one or more prior lines of therapy; 63% received prior radiation therapy. Efficacy results are summarized in Table 101.

Patients were enrolled regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression. Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within two years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by nodal status (positive vs. negative), tumor size (T1/T2 vs. T3/T4), and choice of carboplatin (dosed every 3 weeks vs. weekly). Patients were randomized (2:1) to one of the following two treatment arms; all study medications were administered intravenously: Arm 1: Four cycles of preoperative intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 1-4 of treatment regimen in combination with: Carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 1-4 of treatment regimen -or- AUC 1.5 mg/mL/min every week on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of treatment regimen -and- Paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 every week on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of treatment regimen Followed by four additional cycles of preoperative intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of treatment regimen in combination with: Doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 -or- epirubicin 90 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of treatment regimen -and- Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of treatment regimen Following surgery, nine cycles of intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks were administered. Arm 2: Four cycles of preoperative placebo every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 1-4 of treatment regimen in combination with: Carboplatin AUC 5 mg/mL/min every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 1-4 of treatment regimen -or- AUC 1.5 mg/mL/min every week on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of treatment regimen - and- Paclitaxel 80 mg/m 2 every week on Days 1, 8, and 15 of cycles 1-4 of treatment regimen Followed by four cycles of preoperative placebo every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of treatment regimen in combination with: Doxorubicin 60 mg/m 2 -or- epirubicin 90 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of treatment regimen -and- Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m 2 every 3 weeks on Day 1 of cycles 5-8 of treatment regimen Following surgery, nine cycles of placebo every 3 weeks were administered. The trial was not designed to isolate the effect of intravenous pembrolizumab in each phase (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) of treatment. The main efficacy outcomes were pCR rate and EFS. pCR was defined as absence of invasive cancer in the breast and lymph nodes (ypT0/Tis ypN0) and was assessed by the blinded local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery. EFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first occurrence of any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes definitive surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy, or death due to any cause. An additional efficacy outcome was overall survival (OS). The study population characteristics were: median age of 49 years (range: 22 to 80), 11% age 65 or older; 99.9% female; 64% White, 20% Asian, 4.5% Black, and 1.8% American Indian or Alaska Native; 87% ECOG PS of 0 and 13% ECOG PS of 1; 56% were pre-menopausal status and 44% were post-menopausal status; 7% were primary Tumor 1 (T1), 68% T2, 19% T3, and 7% T4; 49% were nodal involvement 0 (N0), 40% N1, 11% N2, and 0.2% N3; 75% of patients were overall Stage II and 25% were Stage III. Statistically significant improvements in pCR, EFS, and OS were demonstrated at pre-specified interim analyses for patients randomized to intravenous pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy followed by intravenous pembrolizumab as a single agent compared with patients randomized to placebo in combination with chemotherapy followed by placebo alone. Table 102 and Figures 42 and 43 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-522.

Patients with active autoimmune disease that required systemic therapy within 2 years of treatment or a medical condition that required immunosuppression were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by chemotherapy treatment (paclitaxel or paclitaxel protein-bound vs. gemcitabine and carboplatin), tumor PD-L1 expression (CPS ≥1 vs. CPS <1) according to the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit, and prior treatment with the same class of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting (yes vs. no). Patients were randomized (2:1) to one of the following treatment arms; all study medications were administered via intravenous infusion: Intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg on Day 1 every 3 weeks in combination with paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days, paclitaxel 90 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days, or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 and carboplatin AUC 2 mg/mL/min on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Placebo on Day 1 every 3 weeks in combination with paclitaxel protein-bound 100 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 every 28 days, paclitaxel 90 mg/m 2 on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days, or gemcitabine 1000 mg/m 2 and carboplatin AUC 2 mg/mL/min on Days 1 and 8 every 21 days. Assessment of tumor status was performed at Weeks 8, 16, and 24, then every 9 weeks for the first year, and every 12 weeks thereafter. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ, tested in the subgroup of patients with CPS ≥10. Additional efficacy outcome measures were ORR and DoR as assessed by BICR. The study population characteristics for patients were: median age of 53 years (range: 22 to 85), 21% age 65 or older; 100% female; 68% White, 21% Asian, and 4% Black; 60% ECOG PS of 0 and 40% ECOG PS of 1; and 68% were post-menopausal status. Seventy-five percent of patients had tumor PD-L1 expression CPS ≥1 and 38% had tumor PD-L1 expression CPS ≥10. Table 103 and Figures 44 and 45 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-355.
